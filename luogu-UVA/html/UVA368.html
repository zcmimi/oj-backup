&amp;lt;TITLE&amp;gt;Indexing Web Pages&amp;lt;/TITLE&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/HEAD&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;BODY&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;Write a program to create an index of a small collection
of World Wide Web pages. Each &quot;page&quot; is a text file in a
special format called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). The
HTML format includes regular text and special HTML commands,
which are always enclosed in angle braces. For example, the
string &amp;lt;A HREF=&quot;layout.htm&quot;&amp;gt; is an HTML command meaning that
the following text should be highlighted; a user click on
the highlighted text would cause a web browser to fetch and
display the file layout.htm.&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;H1&amp;gt;Following Links&amp;lt;/H1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;Don&#039;t forget that links can be &amp;lt;A HREF=&quot;index.htm&quot;&amp;gt;
self-referential&amp;lt;/A&amp;gt;!&amp;lt;/P&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/BODY&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/HTML&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;A bunch of gibberish and a word&amp;gt;
Note that there is no rule that the file needs to be legal HTML
(if you know the rules), or that words really be wordseiwlaoieu;a.
&amp;lt;A HREF=&quot;index.htm&quot;&amp;gt;Watch out for mutual references!
