## 输入输出样例

### 输入样例 #1

```cpp
A common problem when processing incoming text is to isolate
the words in the text. This is made more difficult by the
punctuation; words have commas, &quot;quote marks&quot;,
(even brackets)
next to them, or hy-
phens in the middle of the word. This punctuation doesn’t
count as letters when the words have to be looked up in a
# dictionary by the 12345 &quot;**&amp;amp;! program.
