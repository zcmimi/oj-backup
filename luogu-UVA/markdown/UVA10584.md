The ACM can’t solve
all the problems in CS. Though large and having
many resources at its disposal, the ACM doesn’t use magic. Magic isn’t
part of science, and hence not part of CS. Thank you for your
suggestions.

ACM
#
The ACM doesn’t like magic.
It’s not that the ACM won’t use it, it’s
just that the ACM doesn’t understand magic.
