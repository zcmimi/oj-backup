## 输入输出样例

### 输入样例 #1

```cpp
Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight, the withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
****END_OF_TEXT****
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
****END_OF_TEXT****
****END_OF_INPUT****
```
