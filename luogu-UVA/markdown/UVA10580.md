Rain Users Guide
While &quot;rain&quot; was intended to be a general purpose tool, at the time of
writing the primary goal was to study one particular software system.
As a result, some steps that are only done once (such as extracting
information from the program under study) are done using cumbersome
ad-hoc techniques that require significant manual intervention. While
&quot;rain&quot; can be used on arbitrary programs, more development work needs
to be done before this is a convenient process.
