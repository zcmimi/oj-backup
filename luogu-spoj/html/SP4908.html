<h1>RLM - Run-Length Mathematics</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Run-length encoding of a number replaces a run of digits (that is, a sequence of consecutive equivalent digits) with the number of digits followed by the digit itself. For example, 44455 would become 3425 (three fours, two fives). Note that run-length encoding does not necessarily shorten the length of the data: 11 becomes 21, and 42 becomes 1412. If a number has more than nine consecutive digits of the same type, the encoding is done greedily: each run grabs as many digits as it can, so 111111111111111 is encoded as 9161.
Implement an integer arithmetic calculator that takes operands and gives results in run-length format. You should support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You won't have to divide by zero or deal with negative numbers.</div>
