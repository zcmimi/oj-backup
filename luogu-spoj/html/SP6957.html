<h1>PARTPAL - Partial Palindrome</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fernando is president of country named Palindromia. Every two years there are elections in Palindromia, but not normal elections. Elections in Palindromia are preformed in next steps:
- Candidate which at the moment isn't president gives to the current president one string **_O,_** which consist only of upper-case letters of english alphabet and character '?', string _**U,**_ which consist only of upper-case letters of english alphabet, and integer **_K_**.
- Current president has one day to compute all longest palindromes in the first string by the folowing rules:
- Every '?' in _**O**_ is substituted with one letter from _**U**_, _**i**_-th '?' in **_O_** with **_i_**-th letter in _**U**_.
- Every time he search for palindromes, he may substitute some '?' with any letter, at most _**K**_-times.
- If he finds palindrome, he goes to step 1.
- If he doesn't succeed, the candidate becomes the new president
- If there are more candidates, go to step one.
Fernando wants to stay president for at least two more years, so he asks you to write program which solves his problem.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input will contain string _**O**_ ( 1 <= lenght of **_O_** <= 5 \* 10^5 ), string which Fernando must compute to stay president. _**O**_ will consist only of upper-case letters of english alphabet and character '?'. You may assume there is at least one '?' in _**O**_.
Second line will contain string _**U**_, string with leads for '?'s. _**i**_-th letter in _**U**_ corespond to _**i**_-th '?' in **_O_**. _**U**_ will consist only of upper-case letters of english alphabet.
Third line will contain integer _**K**_ ( 0 <= K <= 300 ), number of replacements.
**_It is guraranteed that there will be not more than 300 '?'s._**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In first line of output print integer _**S**_, lenght of the longest palindrome that Fernando could find.
In Second and next lines print string _**P** **$ _{i} $**_ and integer **_L $ _{i} $ ,_** longest palindrome and position where it starts. Each _**P** **$ _{i} $**_ must contain only upper-case letters of english alphabet.
**Notes:**
- you must print all longest palindromes, in alphabeticaly increasing order
- if two or more palindromes starts at the same position, print only one of them</div>
