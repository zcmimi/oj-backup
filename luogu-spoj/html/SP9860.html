<h1>GLASS2 - The Glazier 2</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jozo the glazier has once again made N square pieces of glass. The dimensions (sides) of these squares are equal to 1, 2, 3, ..., N - therefore, the areas of these squares equal to 1 $ ^{2} $ , 2 $ ^{2} $ , 3 $ ^{2} $ , ..., N $ ^{2} $ .
Four customers have arrived once again. This time Jozo will sell all N squares of glass. Again, each of the customers must get the same total area of glass (which equals the total area of all N squares divided by four).
Help Jozo and divide his N pieces of glass among the four customers. Assume that the solution (not necesarily unique) exists in all of the test data.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>

<div>An integer N (10</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line, print four numbers: the number of pieces of glass assigned to the first, to the second, to the third and to the fourth customer (respectively).
In i $ ^{th} $ of the next four lines, print the dimensions of the squares of glass assigned to the i $ ^{th} $ customer. (Each square must be assigned to exactly one customer.)</div>
