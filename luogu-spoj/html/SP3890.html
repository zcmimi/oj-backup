<h1>MRECTCNT - Rectangles Counting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/MRECTCNT/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MRECTCNT/vn/)Let R be a rectangle with integer side lengths. The rectangle is divided into unit squares. Considering one of the diagonals, we denote by f(R) the number of squares which have a common interior point with it. For example, if the side lengths of R are 2 and 4 then f(R)=4. Write a program to find out the number of all different rectangles R for which f(R)= N. Two rectangles with sides a x b and b x a are not different.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
