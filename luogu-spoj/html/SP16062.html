<h1>SNGCP - Count Primes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let **num(num >= 0)** is a positive integer or zero. We can represent num in the following two forms if it is possible to do so -
**1.** **num = n $ ^{2} $ + 2 \* n, for non-negative integer n**
**2.** **num = m $ ^{2} $ - 2 \* m,** **for non-negative integer m**
Suppose there is **num** that can be represented in both the forms. Consider this type of number as a magic number. Consider the following 5 cases -
**1. n is the only prime.
2\. m is the only prime.
3\. n and m both are primes.
4\. n is prime.
5\. m is prime.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input is t, total number of test cases. For each test case the first line is q, total number of queries. Then there will be (2 \* q) lines. First line contains c (referring to case mentioned in the problem description) and second line contains two integers a and b defining the range **\[a, b\]** for magic number.
**t < 1001
q < 5001
0 < c < 6
minimum\_value\_of\_a = 0
maximum\_value\_of\_b = 10 $ ^{6} $**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For every test case, that has q queries, the output has (q + 1) lines. First line will be simply printing the test case number and then q lines will be printing total number of magic numbers in the given range \[a, b\] under the specific case mentioned in input.</div>
