<h1>INS16F - Who is the Best?</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Baratheon is one of the oldest houses in the Land of Seven Kingdoms. There have been many kings and their many heirs. The hierarchy is represented as a tree where each character is a node with initial value as the **Varys\_Value** given by Lord Varys. You are the analyser appointed to the current King to give insights about a character.
There are **Q** commands given by the King which can be any of the following type:
1\. Multiply the **Varys\_Value** of all the characters in path from **u** to **v** by a given number **P.**
2\. For a given character **X**, find the number of **ordered pairs (i,j)** such that **LCM(i,j)** is equal to current value at node **X**. (Insight)
For commands of second type, print the number of such pairs (modulo **1000000007**).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains 2 space separated integers **N** and **Q** indicating the number of total characters and number of queries you need to answer.
In the next **N-1** lines, each line contains 2 integers **u**, **v** which indicates a relationship between character **u** and character **v**.
Next line contains **N** space separated integer **V $ _{1} $ , V $ _{2} $ , V $ _{3} $ , ...... V $ _{N} $** where **V $ _{i} $** indicates the Varys\_Value of **i $ ^{th} $** character.
Following **Q** lines contains the queries to be answered.
Types of Queries:
**1 u v P** - Query of first type
**2 X** - Query of second type</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of second type, print the answer to the query in a new line.</div>
