<h1>BIA - Bytelandian Information Agency</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
有n个电脑，电脑与电脑之间可以形成单向通道，给出电脑的连接方式，并保证从1号电脑可以直接或间接到达其他任何电脑。如果缺少某一个电脑会导致1号电脑无法与其他的电脑连接，称这个电脑为重要电脑。问有哪些重要电脑。
输入格式：
第一行为两个正整数n，m。n表示电脑数，m表示通道数。（2<=n<=5000,n-1<=m<=200000）
之后的m行有两个正整数a，b,由空格分开，表示从a号电脑到b号电脑有连接通道，数据保证不存在相同a,b的通道。
输出格式：
第一行为一个整数，为重要电脑的个数。
第二行为所有重要电脑的编号，按从小到大的顺序输出。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bytelandian Information Agency (BIA) uses a net of _n_ computers. The computers are numbered from _1_ to _n_, and the computer number _1_ is a server. The computers are connected by one-way information channels. Every channel connects a pair of computers. The whole network is organised in such a way that one can send information from the server to any other computer either directly or indirectly.
When BIA acquires new information, the information is put on the server and propagated in the net. The chief of BIA considers what would happen if one computer stopped working (was blown away by terrorists for example). It could happen that some other computers would stop receiving information from the server, because the broken computer was a necessary transmitter. We will call such computers _critical_. For example in the situation in the picture below the critical computers are _1_ and _2_. _1_ is the server and all information sent from the server to _3_ has to go through _2_.
![BIA computer net](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP59/dd561e91050c7d6982b27a6d8e4ef886699df64e.png)
### Task
Write a program which
- reads a description of the net from standard input,
- finds all critical computers.
- writes the numbers of critical computers to standard output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each test case consists of several lines. In the first line there are numbers _n_ and _m_. _n_ denotes the number of computers in the net,_(2<=n<=5000)_. _m_ denotes the number of information channels, _n-1<=m<=200000_. The following _m_ lines describes a single information channel and consist of two integer numbers _a_ and _b_ separated by a space. It means the computer _a_ sends information to computer _b_ by that channel. You may assume there are no two channels which start and end at the same points _a, b_.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every testcase your program should write two lines. In the first line _k_ - the number of critical computers in the net. In the second line _k_ numbers separated by single spaces - the numbers of critical computers in increasing order.</div>
