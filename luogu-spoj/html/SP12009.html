<h1>FRSKH - Fibonacci recursive sequences (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leo searched for a new fib-like problem, and ...
it's not a fib-like problem that he found !!! Here it is.
Let FIB the Fibonacci function :
FIB(0)=0 ; FIB(1)=1
and
for N>=2 FIB(N) = FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)
Example : we have FIB(6)=8, and FIB(8)=21.
Let F(K, N) a new function:
F(0, N) = N for all integers N.
F(K, N) = F(K-1, FIB(N) ) for K>0 and all integers N.
Example : F(2, 6) = F(1, FIB(6) ) = F(0, FIB( FIB(6) ) ) = FIB( FIB(6) ) = FIB(8) = 21</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.
In each of the next T lines there are three integers: K, N, M.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print F(K, N),
as the answer could not fit in a 64bit container,
give your answer modulo M.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
