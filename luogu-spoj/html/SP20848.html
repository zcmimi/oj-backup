<h1>IGAME - Interesting Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alice and Bob play an interesting game and the game is played on a number.
So a player, on his chance, can choose any non zero digit of the number and decrease the digit by any non zero amount such that the resulting digit remains non-negative. The player who gets all the digits of the number 0 wins. Both play optimally and Alice starts first. Now tell how many numbers are there between A and B on which if the game is played Alice wins and also find how many numbers are there where Bob wins. On every number between A and B, Alice plays first on that number .
**Input Format**
The Input line consists of T test cases. On each line there are two numbers A and B.
**Output Format**
The Output line consists of T lines each having two numbers.
**Constraints:**
1 1 18
**Sample Input**
2
1 10
101 110
**Sample Output**
10 0
8 2
**Explanation**
