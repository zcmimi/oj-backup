<h1>ICODER - Instruction Decoder</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Mathews uses a brand new 16-bit instruction processor. (Yeah i am being sarcastic!). It has one register (say R) and it supports two instructions:
- ADD X; Impact: R = (R + X) mod 65536
- MUL X; Impact: R = (R \* X) mod 65536
- \[For both instructions 0 <= X <= 65535\]
Mathews sees a segment of code, but doesnot know what value the register had before the code was being executed. How many possible values can the register have after the segment completed execution?
**Input Format:**
The input file consists of multiple testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains one integer, **N**. (1 <= N <= 100,000).
The following **N** lines contain one instructions each.
Input terminates with a line containing N=0, which must not be processed.
**Output Format:**
For each testcase print one integer in a single line, denoting the number of different values the register can take after code execution.
**Sample Input:**
```
1
ADD 3
1
MUL 0
5
MUL 3
ADD 4
MUL 5
ADD 3
MUL 2
8
ADD 32
MUL 5312
ADD 7
MUL 7
ADD 32
MUL 5312
ADD 7
MUL 7
0
```
**Sample Output:**
```
65536
1
32768
16
