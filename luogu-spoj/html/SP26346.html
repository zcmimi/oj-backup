<h1>NINJA3 - STUNNING GCD</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Problem statement:**
You are given three numbers N, a, b. You can build a number X by repeating N 'a' times and the number Y by repeating N 'b' times. Now that you have the numbers X and Y, determine the GCD of the two numbers X and Y.
**Input format:**
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
Then for each test case, there are three integers in each line: **N, a, b**.
**Output format:**
Print the required answer for each test case in a single line.
**Constraints:**
**1 <= T <= 100**
**1 <= N, a, b <= 10 ^ 18**
**Sample input:**
1
123 2 3
**Output:**
