<h1>GCD2 - GCD2</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出两个数a,b。
输出gcd(a,b)
输入第一行为数据组数。
下面每行2个整数，0≤a≤40000，a≤b≤10^250
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Frank explained its friend Felman the algorithm of Euclides to calculate the GCD of two numbers. Then Felman implements it algorithm
```
int gcd(int a, int b)
{
if (b==0)
return a;
else
return gcd(b,a%b);
}
```
and it proposes to Frank that makes it but with a little integer and another integer that has up to 250 digits. Your task is to help Frank programming an efficient code for the challenge of Felman.</div>
