<h1>CODCHESS - Naya Shatranj (New Chess)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A and B are playing a very interesting variant of the ancient Indian game 'shatranj(also known as chess)' on a 'maidaan'(chessboard) n×n in size.
They take turns to put game pieces called 'ghoda'(knight) so that no two 'ghodas'(knights) could threat each other.
A 'ghoda' located in square (a,b) can threat squares (a+1,b+2),(a-1,b+2),(a+1,b-2),(a-1,b-2),(a+2,b-1),(a+2,b+1),(a-2,b-1),(a-2,b+1).
The player who can't put a new 'ghoda' during his move loses. Find out which player wins considering that both players play optimally well and A starts.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
