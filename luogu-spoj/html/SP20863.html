<h1>MINSUB - Largest Submatrix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an matrix M (consisting of nonnegative integers) and an integer K. For any submatrix of M' of M define min(M') to be the minimum value of all the entries of M'. Now your task is simple: find the maximum value of min(M') where M' is a submatrix of M of area at least K (where the area of a submatrix is equal to the number of rows times the number of columns it has).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer T (T</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output two integers: the maximum value of min(M'), where M' is a submatrix of M of area at least K, and the maximum area of a submatrix which attains the maximum value of min(M'). Output a single space between the two integers.</div>
