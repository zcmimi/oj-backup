<h1>INTERVA2 - Interval Challenge</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Give you N ( 1 <= N <= 200000 ) intervals, represented as \[A, B\], for example , interval s represented as \[As,Bs\].
For two intervals s and t, we say S covered by T if At <= As and Bs <= Bt. Now my problem is easy, just tell me the question below: For each interval, how many intervals can cover it but not covered by it ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains multiple test cases.
For each test case, the first line is an integer N ( 1 <= N <= 200000 ), which is the number of intervals. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains two integers: A $ _{i} $ and Bi ( A $ _{i} $ , B $ _{i} $ will not exceed the 32-bit integer) specifying the two parameters described above.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line containing n space-separated integers, the i-th of which specifying the number of intervals that can cover it but not covered by it.</div>
