<h1>NINJA4 - HELP SHELDON</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Problem statement:**
Dr. Sheldon Cooper builds a MVPD replication of himself which he calls a "Mobile Virtual Presence Device" (MVPD) that would go through all the hazards of life that he would otherwise have to
experience while he stays behind in a "secure, undisclosed location". Now the MVPD is initially standing at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, (0, 0). (More like Sheldon's spot (0, 0, 0, 0)). Then
the MVPD makes N turns:-
- <a name="MathJax-Element-31-Frame"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-165"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-166"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-167"></a> On the first turn, the MVPD goes 1 unit to the right.
- <a name="MathJax-Element-32-Frame"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-168"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-169"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-170"></a> On the second turn, the MVPD goes 2 units up.
- <a name="MathJax-Element-33-Frame"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-171"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-172"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-173"></a> On the third turn, the MVPD goes 3 units to the left.
- <a name="MathJax-Element-34-Frame1"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-174"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-175"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-176"></a> On the fourth turn, the MVPD goes 4 units down.
- On the fifth turn, the MVPD goes 5 units to the right.
- And so on.
Given an integer N, find the position of Sheldon's MVPD so that he won't get lost somewhere.
**Input Format**
<a name="MathJax-Element-37-Frame1"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-183"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-184"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-185"></a> The first line contains a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
<a name="MathJax-Element-39-Frame1"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-189"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-190"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-191"></a> For each test case, a single line contains a single integer - the value of N.
Output format:
<a name="MathJax-Element-42-Frame"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-2081"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-2091"></a><a name="MathJax-Span-2101"></a> For each test case output a single line, containing two integers - the coordinates of the MVPD after performing N turns.
**Constraints:**
1 <= T <= 100.
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9.
**Sample input:**
