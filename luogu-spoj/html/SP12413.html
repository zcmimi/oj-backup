<h1>PONY6 - Toward Infinity</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Story: Twilight Sparkle was working on some formulas when she came across a strange pattern.
When she added 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ..., she saw that it kept getting closer and closer to 1.
She was able to figure out that problem and a few more, but there are others that are too difficult. She needs your help.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You will be given a number T on the first line. The following T lines will be of the form
S k r
where S is a String label with no spaces, and both k and r are as described above.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your output will contain T lines of the form
S N / D
where S is the label you were given in the input, N is the numerator of the answer, and D is the denominator. D may be 1.
To be more precise, if the fraction is negative, then output the negative sign next to N.</div>
