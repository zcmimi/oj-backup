<h1>SERCOVERAGE - Coverage</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A cellular provider has installed n towers to support their network. Each tower provides coverage in a 1km radius, and no two towers are closer than 1km to each other. The coverage region of this network is therefore the set of all points that are no more than 1km away from at least one tower. The provider wants as much of this region as possible to be connected, in the sense that a user at any point within a connected subregion can travel to any other point within the connected subregion without having to exit the subregion. Their current installation of towers may or may not already form a single connected region, but they have the resources to build one more tower wherever they want, including within 1km of an existing tower. Given that the provider is able to build one more tower, what is the maximum number of towers (including the new one) that can be included within a single connected subregion of coverage?</div>
