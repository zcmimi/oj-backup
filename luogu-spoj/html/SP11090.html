<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>翻译：
Bessie正在从国外长途旅行回到根西岛，而Farmer John希望为她的到来安装一个漂亮的“欢迎之家”横幅。Farmer John的字段具有整数尺寸M x N（1 <= M，N <= 100,000），并且他已经在整个坐标的字段中的每个可能点处安装了一个帖子（如果我们为该字段分配坐标系以便（ 0,0）位于左下角，（M，N）位于右上角。在这些（M + 1）*（N + 1）点中，Farmer John必须选择两个作为横幅的端点。
作为完美主义者的农夫约翰坚持认为旗帜必须完全平直。这意味着，对于他选择的两个帖子，线段上不会有任何其他帖子，它们之间将形成横幅。此外，Farmer John希望横幅的长度至少为L且最多为H（1 <= L <= H <= 150,000）。农夫约翰需要你的帮助来弄清楚他可以悬挂横幅的方式有多少。横幅是可逆的，因此切换横幅的两个端点的方式与挂起横幅的方式相同。由于这个数字可能非常大，Farmer John只想知道它是什么模B（1 <= B <= 1,000,000,000）。
考虑下面的例子，M = 2且N = 2：
* * *
* * *
* * *
农夫约翰希望横幅的长度在1到3之间（包括1和3）。任何帖子的选择都满足这个长度要求，但请注意，不能选择8对：
（0,0）和（2,0）:( 1,0）在它们之间的线段上（0,1）和（2,1）:( 1,1）在它们之间的线段上（0） ，2）和（2,2）:( 1,2）在它们之间的线段（0,0）和（2,2）:( 1,1）在它们之间的线段上（0,0） ）和（0,2）:( 0,1）位于它们之间的线段（1,0）和（1,2）:( 1,1）位于它们之间的线段（2,0）和（2,2）:( 2,1）位于它们之间的线段（0,2）和（2,0）:( 1,1）位于它们之间的线段上
因此，总共有（9选2） - 8 = 28个可能的位置。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bessie is returning from a long trip abroad to the Isle of Guernsey, and Farmer John wants to mount a nice "Welcome Home" banner for her arrival. Farmer John's field has integer dimensions M x N (1 <= M, N <= 100,000), and he has installed a post at every possible point in the field with integer coordinates (if we assign a coordinate system to the field so that (0,0) is in the lower-left corner and (M,N) is in the upper-right corner). Of these (M+1) \* (N+1) points, Farmer John must pick two as the endpoints of the banner.
Farmer John, being the perfectionist that he is, insists that the banner must be completely straight. This means that, for the two posts he chooses, there cannot be any other post on the line segment that the banner will form between them. Additionally, Farmer John wants the banner to have length at least L and at most H (1 <= L <= H <= 150,000). Farmer John needs your help to figure out how many possible ways he can hang the banner. The banner is reversible, so switching the two endpoints of the banner counts as the same way to hang the banner. As this number may be very large, Farmer John simply wants to know what it is modulo B (1 <= B <= 1,000,000,000).
Consider the example below, with M = 2 and N = 2:
\* \* \*
\* \* \*
\* \* \*
Farmer John wants the length of the banner to be between 1 and 3 inclusive. Any choice of posts satisfies this length requirement, but note that eight pairs cannot be picked:
(0, 0) and (2, 0): (1, 0) is on the line segment between them (0, 1) and (2, 1): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them (0, 2) and (2, 2): (1, 2) is on the line segment between them (0, 0) and (2, 2): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them (0, 0) and (0, 2): (0, 1) is on the line segment between them (1, 0) and (1, 2): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them (2, 0) and (2, 2): (2, 1) is on the line segment between them (0, 2) and (2, 0): (1, 1) is on the line segment between them
Therefore, there are a total of (9 choose 2) - 8 = 28 possible locations.</div>
