<h1>WM06 - Soccer Choreography</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>比特曼是比特兰国家足球队的教练，他是一个完美主义者。他教他的球员最优的战术，并提高他们的耐力和形状。所以他们有资格参加今年的足球狼杯比赛。由于他的完美主义，教练不仅重视比赛中的表现，而且重视比赛前的表现。因此，他告诉队长，在国歌响起之前，球队应该以什么样的队形集合。由于每11名队员的球衣上都有一个独特的数字介于1到11之间，所以他可以将队形表示为数字的排列。
在第一场比赛之前，教练告诉队长，球队应该排成一排(图(D)。但是有些球员忘记了队形的顺序和方向，就像图(A)中一样。只有1号球员有正确的方向。当教练看到这个暴君时，他几乎发疯了！他怎么能解决这个问题？
scenario example
“嗯…我让我的选手跳舞！”好主意！他拿起他的笔记本，开始创作一个编舞，这导致了他的预期形成。由于没有人上舞蹈课，他把他的舞蹈限制在一个基本动作上：一个或多个并排站立的球员可以在移动的中心旋转180度。图(B)包含一个例子：玩家
<pre style="text-align:center;">-11 -10 -9 -2(我们给站在错误方向上的球员打上负号)

<pre style="text-align:center;">2 9 10 11尽管他很完美，但他用最少的舞步算出了一支舞。它的运作非常完美，现在他正计划与11名以上成员的团队一起表演舞蹈。所以他需要你的帮助才能找到最佳的舞步.。

    <h2>题目描述</h2>
    <div>Mr. Bitmann, the coach of the national soccer team of Bitland, is a perfectionist. He taught his players optimal tactics and improved their endurance and shape. So they qualified for the soccer woldcup this year. Due to his perfectionism the coach attaches importance not only to the performance in the game but also before the game. So he told the team captain in what formation the team should assemble before the national anthem is played. Since each of the 11 team members has a unique number between 1 and 11 on his shirt, he can represent the formation as a permutation of numbers.

Before the first game the coach told the captain that the team should line up in increasing order (picture (d)). But some players forgot the ordering and the orientation of the formation like in picture (a). Only player 1 has the right orientation. The coach went nearly mad when he saw this desaster! How could he solve the problem?

![scenario example](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP850/eeb842bacbd5572c6d9c578fd589191e24d6508c.png)

"Hmmm... I'll let my players dance!". A great idea! He took his notebook and started to create a choreography which leads to his expected formation. Due to the fact that no one of the players took dancing lessons he restricts his dance to one basic move: One player or more players who stand side by side can turn 180 degrees around the center of the move. Picture (b) contains an example: The players

 `<pre style="text-align:center;">-11 -10 -9 -2`(we mark players which stand in the wrong direction with a minus) can do one move to

 `<pre style="text-align:center;">2 9 10 11`As perfect as he is he calculated a dance with a minimum number of moves. It works perfectly and now he's planning to do dancing performances with teams with more than 11 members. So he needs your help to find optimal dancing moves...</div>
