<h1>PRLGAME2 - A Famous Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mr. B and Mr. M like to play with balls. They have many balls colored in blue and red. Firstly, Mr. B randomly picks up **N** balls out of them and put them into a bag. Mr. M knows that there are **N**+1 possible situation which the number of red balls are ranged from 0 to **N**, and we assume the possibilities of the **N**+1 situation are the same. But Mr. M does not know which situation occurs. Secondly, Mr. M picks up P balls out of the bag and examines them. There are **Q** red balls and **P**-**Q** blue balls. The question is, if he picks one more ball out of the bag, what is the possibility that this ball is red.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each test case contains only one line with three integers **N**, **P** and **Q** (2 <= **N** <= 100,000, 0 <= **Q** <= **P** <= **N**-1).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the possibility of the next ball Mr. M picks out is red. The number should be round to four decimal places.
**The judge is "ignoring extra whitespaces".**</div>
