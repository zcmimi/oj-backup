<h1>PSYCHON - Psycho</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer N, the number N is called “**Psycho Number**” . Psycho Number is calculated as follows:
First, If we factorize N , then we have some prime and their power. Assume that, there are M powers. From M powers , you should count the number of even and odd powers. Then if the number of even power is strictly greater than odd power , then we call the number N is “**Psycho Number**”, otherwise the number N is call “**Ordinary Number**”.
As for example, if N = 67500 then prime factorization,
67500 = 2 $ ^{2} $ x 3 $ ^{3} $ x 5 $ ^{4} $ .
`Count even powers and odd powers . This number have 2 even power(2,4) and 1 odd power ( 3 ). Since even power 2 (2,4) is greater than odd power 1 (3), so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.`**Input:**
An integer **T** (1 <= **T** <= 10 $ ^{6} $ ) denoting the number of test cases followed by T lines. Each containing a single integer **N** ( 1 <= **N** <= 10 $ ^{7} $ ) .
**Output:**
For each case print “**Psycho Number**” or “**Ordinary Number**”.
**Sample Input/Output:**
**Sample Input**
**Sample Output**
```
2
3
4
```
```
Ordinary Number
Psycho Number
```
```
Note : 0 and 1 is not a psycho number .
Psycho 2 : Psycho Function
Psycho 3 : Make Psycho 
```
`Psycho 4 : Psycho34 (easy)` ```
