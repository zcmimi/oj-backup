<h1>UNTITLED - Untitled Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We consider a sequence **S $ _{1} $** is **equal** to a sequence **S $ _{2} $** , if and only if they satisfy the following conditions:
- The length of them are equal.
- Let **Len** be the length of them. For each i,j(1 <= i, j <= **Len**, i != j):If **S $ _{1} $** \[i\] is smaller than **S $ _{1} $** \[j\], **S $ _{2} $** \[i\] must be smaller than **S $ _{2} $** \[j\]; If **S $ _{1} $** \[i\] is greater than **S $ _{1} $** \[j\], **S $ _{2} $** \[i\] must greater than **S $ _{2} $** \[j\].
Now you are given a sequence **S** and another **N** sequences **T $ _{1} $** , **T $ _{2} $** …. **T $ _{N} $** .
We say position **i** is **OK**, if and only if **S**\[1..**i**\] contains a suffix which is **equal** to a sequence from { **T $ _{1} $** , **T $ _{2} $** ... **T $ _{N} $** }. You need to print the positions which is **OK** in increasing order.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases, the number of them(no more than 3) is given in the very first line.
For each test case:
- The first line contains an integer **M** (**M** > 1) which denote the number of sequences. **i.e.** **M** = **N** + 1.
- **M** \* 2 lines follow, each two lines describe one sequence.For each two lines, the first line contains an integer **L** which denote the length of this sequence. The second line contains **L** integers(all the integers don't exceed 2 $ ^{31} $ -1) that represent this sequence. The first sequence described is **S**, the next **N** sequences represent **T $ _{1} $** ... **T $ _{N} $** .
- You can assume that there are no same integer in any one sequence.
- The length of **S** is no more than 400000, and the total length of **T** is no more than 100000.</div>
