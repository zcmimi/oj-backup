<h1>WINDOW1 - Window</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>我们在直角坐标系中选择了一个多边形。多边形的边与坐标轴平行。每两个连续的边都是垂直的，每个顶点的坐标都是整数。我们还给出了一个窗口，它的矩形与坐标轴平行。多边形的内部（但不是它的外围）是彩色的。通过窗口可以看到多边形的红色碎片的数目是多少？

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We have a polygon chosen in the cartesian coordinate system. Sides of the polygon are parallel to the axes of coordinates. Every two consecutive sides are perpendicular and coordinates of every vertex are integers. We have also given a window that is a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the axes of coordinates. The interior of the polygon (but not its periphery) is coloured red. What is the number of separate red fragments of the polygon that can be seen through the window?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The number of test cases _t_ is in the first line of input, then _t_ test cases follow separated by an empty line.
In the first line of a test case there are four integers _x_ $ _{1} $ , _y_ $ _{1} $ , _x_ $ _{2} $ , _y_ $ _{2} $ from the range \[0..10000\], separated by single spaces. The numbers _x_ $ _{1} $ , _y_ $ _{1} $ are the coordinates of the top-left corner of the window. The numbers _x_ $ _{2} $ , _y_ $ _{2} $ are the coordinates of the bottom-right corner of the window. The next line of the input file contains one integer _n_, 4 <= _n_ <= 5000, which equals the number of vertices of the polygon. In the following _n_ lines there are coordinates of polygon's vertices given in anticlockwise direction, i.e. the interior of the polygon is on the left side of its periphery when we move along the sides of the polygon according to the given order. Each line contains two integers _x_, _y_ separated by a single space, 0 <= _x_ <= 10000, 0 <= _y_ <= 10000. The numbers in the _i_-th line, are coordinates of the _i_-th vertex of the polygon.</div>

<div>For each test case you should output one line with the number of separate red fragments of the polygon that can be seen through the window.</div>
