<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Task**
You are given **K** points with positive integer coordinates. You are also given **M** triangles, each of them having one vertex in the origin and the other 2 vertices with non-negative integer coordinates.
You are asked to determine for each triangle whether it has at least one of the **K** given points inside. (None of the K points are on any edge of any triangle.)
**Input**
The first line of the input file will contain **K** and **M**. The following **K** lines will contain 2 positive integers **x** **y** separated by one space that represent the coordinates of each point. The next **M** lines have 4 non-negative integers separated by one space, (**x1**, **y1**) and (**x2**, **y2**), that represent the other 2 vertices of each triangle, except the origin.
**Output**
The output file should contain exactly **M** lines. The _k_-th line should contain the character **Y** if the _k_-th triangle (in the order of the input file) contains at least one point inside it, or **N** otherwise.
**Constraints**
- 1 K,**M**
- 1 K points
- 0
- Triangles are not degenerate (they all have nonzero area).
- In 50% of the test cases, all triangles have vertices with coordinates **x1=0** and
**y2=0**. That is, one edge of the triangle is on the _x_-axis, and another is on the _y_-axis.
