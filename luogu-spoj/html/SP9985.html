<h1>DISTX - Distance</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个序列$a$，定义$d(i,j)=$把$a[i]$变成$a[j]$的最少操作次数。每次操作可以对$a[i]$乘以一个或除以一个质数p。
对于每个$i$，求$d(i,j)$最小的$j$，若有多个解，输出最小的$j$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this task let's consider distance between two positive integers defined as below.
Single operation is : multiplying some number by prime number or dividing some number by prime number ( we can divide only when remainder is equal to 0 )
Distance d between two numbers a,b is minimum number operations to convert one number to another.
For example d(69,42)=3
This distance is very similiar to well-known term "distance" in real human life:
d(a,a)=0 , distance number to itself is 0
d(a,b)=d(b,a) distance from a->b is equal to b->a
d(a,b)+d(b,c)>=d(a,c) triangle equation is true too
With given n number you have to determine for each i-th of those numbers closest number aj from set that
i!=j and if there is many numbers with equal, smallest distance, you have to pick number with smallest index</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In first line - number n <=10^5.
In next n lines - i-th number. Every number is not greater than 10^6</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You have to output n lines.
I-th line should contain index of closest number ( if there is many answers, please output smallest index )</div>
