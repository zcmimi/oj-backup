<h1>PLUSEVI - How Many Plusses</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mirko is a strange boy so he has written down a square matrix full of ones and zeroes. Now he is interested in how many plusses there are in his matrix.
A plus is a square such that its side has an odd length greater than 1 and all of its cells are zero, except for the middle row and the middle column: they must be full of ones. For example, in the matrix below there are two plusses, one inside the other:
00100
00100
11111
00100
00100</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line there is an integer N
The next N lines are the rows of the matrix.</div>
