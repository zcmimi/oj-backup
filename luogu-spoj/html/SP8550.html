<h1>LSQF - Longest Square Factor</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a string x, the string obtained by concatenating x to itself is sometimes called the square of x.
Given a string s, output the longest string x such that its square is a substring of s. If you find more than one solution, output the lexicographically smallest.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of input contains a string s (consisting only of lowercase letters of the english alphabet). The length of s is less than or equal to 10 $ ^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>To the first line of output print the length of the string x.
To the second line print the string x.
Such a string will always exist in the test data.</div>
