<h1>NPC2015E - Eefun Plays LOL</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 故事背景
Palkia这几天在玩一款叫做“Lol of Legend”的流行游戏。在这个游戏中，每个玩家都会控制一个战士，这些战士有一些可以帮助自己的技能，大家是通过击败对方来获取比赛的胜利。然而，Palkia队伍里的Eefun却无法做到这一点，他只想让自己的战士变强。
Palkia愤怒地用他的超能力击杀了Eefan，接着又摧毁了他所居住的世界。现在Eefan被困在了名叫"NLC"的世界中，被困的这几天中，他遇到了Elsee。这令他发现，在NLC中的人们喜欢解谜语或逻辑谜题。时间飞逝，Eefan参加了一场竞赛，而且顺利的进入决赛。可是在决赛中，Eefan必须解决这个问题：
Elsee父亲有一个相当大的椰子农场。这个农场的椰子有不同的耐久值。耐久值由椰子不断裂的情况下掉落的高度来确定。如果椰子开始的耐久值是50，那么它从51的高度掉下来就会摔碎。但是，如果椰子从50英尺的高度掉下来，它不会破碎或损坏。每个椰子的耐久值最低为0，最高为2014。Elsee的父亲给了他两个相同耐久值的椰子，但是Elsee不知道它们的耐久值。Elsee想通过从大楼的窗户上扔下来测试它们的耐久值。最坏的情况是，Elsee从高度为2014的大楼上扔下椰子。Elsee最少要试验多少次才能知道它们的耐久值
遗憾的是，Eefun没有回答上来这个问题，所以他被淘汰了。比赛结束后，Eefun从Elsee那得到了答案：63次。但是我们的Eefun绝不服输，他相信自己总有一天会赢得竞赛的冠军。
Palkia觉得自己对Eefun很过分，所以他找到了一个和他摧毁的前一个世界差不多的世界，接着他把之前世界的每一个居民都带到了那个新世界。
Eefun很伤心，因为Palkia的行为所以他再也不能参加NLC世界的竞赛了。Eefun不希望他和Elsee的友谊白白消失，然后他根据那道难倒他的问题为原型创建了一个编程问题。然后Eefun将他编写问题提交给一个编程竞赛，接着这个竞赛将使用这个问题。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Palkia is playing a popular game called "Lol of Legend". In that game, each player controls 1 champion where each champion has a finite number of skills. These skills can be used to empower other champions.
The main objective of this game is to defeat the enemies with these champions. However, one of Palkia's team member, Eefun, is unable to do that. Eefun only try to make his champions powerful.
Palkia angrily smashes the world where Eefun live with his superpower. Eefun is now stranded in NLC world and he meets Elsee. It turns out that the people of NLC world like playing with riddles and logic puzzles. Long story short, Eefun entered a logic contest and reach the finals. In the finals, Eefun has to solve this problem:
> Elsee's father has a quite large coconut farm. The coconuts in this farm have different durabilities. Durability is determined by how high the coconut can be dropped without breaking. If a coconut has 50 durability, then it will break if dropped from 51 height. But, the coconut will not break or damaged if dropped from 50 height. Each coconut has a minimum of 0 and maximum of 2014 durability. Elsee is given two coconuts with the same durability by his father, however Elsee doesn't know their durabilities. Elsee wants to test the durability by dropping them from the window of a building. Worst case scenario, what is the minimum number of times Elsee need to drop the coconuts to know their durabilities? The building Elsee in has a height of 2014.
Eefun can't answer the question so he is eliminated. After the contest, Eefun got the solution from Elsee, which is 63. Eefun is determined to win the logic contest one day.
Palkia is feeling bad after what he's done, then he find another world that is similar to the previous world he destroyed, and he returned every inhabitant from the previous world to that new world. Eefun is sad because he can no longer enter the logic contest in NLC world. Eefun does not want his friendship with Elsee goes to waste so he created programming problem based on the problem that stumped him. Eefun then submits his problem to a programming contest and that problem is used in the contest. Here is the prolem:
Elsee's father has a quite large coconut farm. The coconuts in this farm have different durabilities. Durability is determined by how high the coconut can be dropped without breaking. If a coconut has 50 durability, then it will break if dropped from 51 height. But, the coconut will not break or damaged if dropped from 50 height. Each coconut has a minimum of 0 and maximum of **N** durability. Elsee is given **K** coconuts with the same durability by his father, however Elsee doesn't know their durabilities. Elsee wants to test the durability by dropping them from the window of a building. Worst case scenario, what is the minimum number of times Elsee need to drop the coconuts to know their durabilities? The building Elsee in has a height of **N**.</div>
