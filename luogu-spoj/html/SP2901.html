<h1>GEOPROB - One Geometry Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> This is a problem of Euclidean Geometry. See the figure below.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2901/3d51d9de3bdeb7830c688ef9fefa5764ec6c1de6.png)
Your task is as follows: given the lengths of segments b, c, and d, calculate the length of segment a.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=300). In each of the next t lines there are three integers b, c and d (0 <= b, c and d <= 10 $ ^{200} $ ; b,d < c) separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every test case print the length of the segment a, one number per line.</div>
