<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>RoboCorp Oregon has already deployed several of its PoliceBots throughout the state, and suddenly they have remembered the importance of being able to repair these bots when they break. They are willing to build only a limited number of repair depots in the state, and they want to locate these depots so that each PoliceBot's city is within a given distance of some depot. You are given the locations of where the n (1</div>

<div>The first line contains the integer t (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You are to print for each input set the minimum value that can be obtained, such that each PoliceBot is within that distance of some depot. You should print your result with at least one digit before and exactly six digits after the decimal point; your value should be within 5e-7 of the true result. To make round-off error less of a concern, the true result will never have a 4 or a 5 as the seventh digit after the decimal point.</div>
