<h1>LANDFILL - Landfill</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a sequence H\[1\], H\[2\], ... , H\[N\] representing the initial heights of N pieces of land and an integer K. It costs C\[i\] Rupees to elevate each of H\[i\], H\[i+1\], ... , H\[i+K-1\] by E\[i\]; if i+K > N, it will just elevate all the pieces of land from A\[i\] to A\[N\] - Let us call this an _operation_. The following constraints must be satisfied:
1\) For each i, the _operation_ can be performed atmost once.
2\) The sum of the costs of all the operations performed must be <= Budget.
You have to calculate the maximum height V such that each plot's elevation is atleast V before you exhaust the budget.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains 3 integers N, Budget and K.
The next N lines consists of 3 integers H\[i\], E\[i\] and C\[i\].</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer V such that all the plots have atleast height V.</div>
