<h1>EMTY2 - Can You Make It Empty 2</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string S with only 0 and 1. You can delete the string 100 from any position of S an infinite number of times and obtain a new S after concatenation. Is it possible to make the string empty?
As for example, if S=101000 then 10**100**0->**100->**empty
If S=1010001 then 10**100**01->**100**1->1->not empty
**Input**
Input starts with an integer **T (, denoting the number of test cases.**
Each case contains a string S. The size of string is at most 120000.
**Output**
For each test case, print the case number and “yes” if it is possible to make the string S empty, print “no” otherwise.
**Sample Input**
**Output for Sample Input**
2
101000
1010001
Case 1: yes
Case 2: no
