<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are 3 kinds of animals A,B and C. A can eat B,B can eat C,C can eat A. It's interesting,isn't it?
Now we have n animals,numbered from 1 to n. Each of them is one of the 3 kinds of animals:A,B,C.
Today Mary tells us k pieces of information about these n animals. Each piece has one of the two forms below:
- 1 x y: It tells us the kind of x and y are the same.
- 2 x y: It tells us x can eat y.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer t.t blocks follow.
To every block,the first line contains two integers n(1<=n<=50000) and k (1<=k<=100000). k lines follow,each contains 3 positive integers D(1<=D<=2),X,Y,separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>t lines,each contains a single integer - the number of false pieces in the corresponding block.</div>
