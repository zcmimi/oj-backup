<h1>KOICOST - Cost</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an undirected graph with N verticies and M edges, where the weights are unique.
There is a function Cost(u, v), which is defined as follows:
While there is a path between vertex u and v, delete the edge with the smallest weight. Cost(u,v) is the sum of the weights of the edges that were deleted in this process.
![graph](../../content/francky:cost-graph "graph")
For example, from the graph above (same as the sample input), Cost(2,6) is 2+3+4+5+6 = 20.
Given an undirected graph, your task is to calculate the sum of Cost(u,v) for all vertices u and v, where u < v. Since the answer can get large, output the answer modulo 10^9.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input consists of two integers, N and M. (1 <= N <= 100,000, 0 <= M <= 100,000)
The next M lines consists of three integers, u, v, and w. This means that there is an edge between vertex u and v with weight w. (1 <= u, v <= N, 1 <= w <= 100,000)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the sum specified in the problem statement.</div>
