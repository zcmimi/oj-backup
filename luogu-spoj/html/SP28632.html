2\) **2 y** : report the number of numbers in the multiset that are smaller than or equal to **y**.
3\) ****3 z**** : report the **z**th smallest number of the multiset. Note that if any number **d** appears more than once, it is to be counted as many times it appears! Also, if z exceeds the number of elements in the **multiset**, that is answer for this query doesn't exist, print "**invalid".** Look at the sample input for clarification.</div>
