<h1>GRAPH2 - Graph</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given an undirected graph with **n** nodes and **m** weighted edges, every node having one of two colors - black (denoted as 0) and white (denoted as 1). You are to perform **q** operations of two kinds:
1. **C** x: Change the _x_-th node´s color. A black node should be changed into a white node, and vice versa.
2. **Q** A B: Find the sum of weight of edges whose two end points of color A and B. A and B can be either 0 or 1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers **n** (1<=**n**<=10^5) and **m**(1<=**m**<= 10^5) specified above.
The second line contains **n** integers, the _i_-th of which represents the color of the _i_-th node, 0 for black and 1 for white.
The following **m** lines represent edges. Each line has three integer u, v and w(1<=u, v<=n, u!=v), indicating there is an edge of weight w between u and v. w fits into 32-bit signed integer.
The next line contains only one integer **q**(1<=**q**<= 10^5), the number of operations.
The following **q** lines - operations mentioned above. See samples for detailed format.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each **Q** query, print one line containing the desired answer.See samples for detailed format.</div>
