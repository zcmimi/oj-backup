<h1>OPBIT - Operation Bits</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Operation bits - A new operation conducted by the secret team currently working on a project on security enhancement. Mr.Abay, the team head, has found a new pattern on the perfect squares. This can be used as a outer cover for his project as its securing power is low. So he assign you this problem to find the key based on the given conditions:
"An two adjacent perfect squares have their absolute difference as an odd number except when a and b are equal. Your task is to find the key which is deined as:
key(a,b) where a and b are perfect squares is ( ( AND( absolute difference betwen every adjacent perfect squares in \[a,b\]) ) AND ( XOR( absolute difference betwen every adjacent perfect squares in \[a,b\]) ) )"
Find the key for the given inputs :)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input begins with a number T (1<=T<=1000) where T is the number of testcases.
T lines follow
Each line has two numbers a and b (0 < a <= b <= 10^6)
It is assured that a and b are perfect squares.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print the corresponding key</div>
