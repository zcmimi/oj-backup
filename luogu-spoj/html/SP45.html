<div># 题目描述
所谓“即兴喜剧”是一种戏剧类型，最早的演出可追溯至十六世纪初的意大利。其灵感来源于古罗马大剧场。这种表演没有固定的剧本，演员需要做出大量的即兴发挥。创作者只会给出一个简单的方向，譬如“走上舞台并做一些搞笑的事”，或者“每个人都上台，结果皆大欢喜”。你可以发现，表演即兴喜剧可能会非常有趣。因此，ACM想安排一场前所未见的演出。英雄主角遇到了一个拼图。这个拼图在剧中扮演了非常重要的角色，提供了许多即兴创作的机会。它就是世界知名的“劳埃德15拼图”。ACM想让表演变得更加有趣，所以他们想用一个三维的问题替代“标准”的拼图。
这个拼图由一个立方体组成，包括了$M^{3}$个插槽。除了一个插槽以外，每个插槽都包含了一个三维拼图块（或者说，有一个位置是空的）。拼图块从$1$到$m^{3}-1$依次编号。拼图的目标在于，在拼图块随机洗牌后，恢复它们的原始顺序。唯一允许的动作是：沿着三个主方向之一，将临近的拼图块移动至空位置。原始布局规定如下：任意被赋予了在$\{0,\dots,M-1\}^3$范围内的坐标$(x,y,z)$的拼图块，其编号为$z\cdot M^{2}+y\cdot M+x+1$，并且$(M-1,M-1,M-1)$为空位置。
你需要写一个程序，确定拼图是否可解。
# 输入格式：
输入包含$N$组数据。输入第一行只有一个正整数$N$。然后输入每组数据。每组数据的第一行包括了一个正整数$M$，$1\leq M\leq 100$，$M$是拼图立方体的的大小。接下来的$M$行，每行包括了$M^{2}$个数，从顶层到底层给出了每一层插槽集合的数据。每一层的数据按行主序从左上角到右下角排列。换句话说，插槽$(x,y,z)$由第$z+1$行的第$(x+M\cdot y+1)$个数据描述。数据之间由空格隔开。$0$代表空位置。
# 输出格式：
对每一组数据，输出一行。如果能通过滑动拼图块恢复原始布局，输出Puzzle can be solved. 否则输出Puzzle is unsolvable.
# 说明：
警告：输入输出量很大，使用某些语言时应注意</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>So called _commedia dell' arte_ is a theater genre first played in Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century. It was inspired with the Roman Theater. The play had no fixed script and the actors (also called _performers_) had to improvise a lot. There were only a simple directions by the author like "enter the stage and make something funny" or "everyone comes on stage and everything is resolved happily". You can see it might be very interesting to play the commedia dell' arte. Therefore the ACM want to put a new play on a stage, which was completely unknown before. The main hero has a puzzle that takes a very important role in the play and gives an opportunity of many improvisations. The puzzle is the worldwide known _Lloyd's Fifteen Puzzle_. ACM wants to make the play more interesting so they want to replace the "standard" puzzle with a three-dimensional one. The puzzle consists of a cube containing M $ ^{3} $ slots. Each slot except one contains a cubic tile (one position is free). The tiles are numbered from 1 to M $ ^{3} $ -1. The goal of the puzzle is to get the original ordering of the tiles after they have been randomly reshuffled. The only allowed moves are sliding a neighbouring tile into the free position along one of the three principal directions. Original configuration is when slot with coordinates (x,y,z) from {0,...,M-1} $ ^{3} $ contains tile number z.M $ ^{2} $ +y.M+x+1 and slot (M-1,M-1,M-1) is free.
You are to write a program to determine whether it is possible to solve the puzzle or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of N cases. The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. The first line of each case contains only one integer M, 1 <= M <= 100. It is the size of 3D puzzle cube. Then follow M lines, each contains exactly M $ ^{2} $ numbers on the tiles for one layer. First is the layer on the top of the cube and the last one on the bottom. In each layer numbers are arranged from the left top corner linewise to the right bottom corner of the layer. In other words, slot with coordinates (x,y,z) is described by the (x+M.y+1)-th number on the (z+1)-th line. Numbers are separated by space. Number 0 means free position.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case, print exactly one line. If the original configuration can be reached by sliding the tiles, print the sentence 'Puzzle can be solved.'. Otherwise, print the sentence 'Puzzle is unsolvable.'.</div>
