<h1>CTFLAG - Flag</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>According to a new ISO standard, a flag of every country should have, strangely enough, a chequered field _n_ × _m_, each square should be wholly painted one of 26 colours. The following restrictions are set:
- In each row at most two different colours can be used.
- No two adjacent squares can be painted the same colour.
Pay attention, please, that in one column more than two different colours can be used.
Berland's government took a decision to introduce changes into their country's flag in accordance with the new standard, at the same time they want these changes to be minimal. By the given description of Berland's flag you should find out the minimum amount of squares that need to be painted different colour to make the flag meet the new ISO standard. You are as well to build one of the possible variants of the new Berland's flag.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first input line contains 2 integers _n_ and _m_ (1 n, _m_ ) — amount of rows and columns in Berland's flag respectively. Then there follows the flag's description: each of the following _n_ lines contains _m_ characters. Each character is a letter from a to z, and it stands for the colour of the corresponding square.</div>
