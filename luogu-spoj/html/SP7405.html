<h1>PANCAKES - Delicious Pancakes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Just as promised, PolyProg will invite you to a bounteous pancake buffet right after this contest. Can you already feel the seductive odours dazing your senses? Well, before your mouth starts watering, you should solve this last problem.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP7405/21cd3fa877a7290a6a919e6517914667a2dcf704.png)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of several test-cases separated by an empty line. The first line of each test-case holds the number of ingredients _N (1<=N<=50)_ the assistant bought followed by the number of recipes _R (1<=R<=100)_ in the chef’s repertoire. Each of the next lines contains exactly _N_ non-negative integers (no larger than 10 $ ^{6} $ ) informing about the ingredients. The first of these lines lists the quantities the assistant bought of each ingredient. The remaining _R_ lines list the quantities (in the same order as the previous line) necessary to make ten pancakes according to the recipe r $ _{i} $ (from 1 to _R_). The input ends on a test-case having both _N_ and _R_ zero, which must not be processed.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your program should produce one line per test-case containing the recipe that yields the largest number of pancakes followed by the number of entire pancakes that can be made then. If there is a tie, prefer the recipe that appears first in the input.
