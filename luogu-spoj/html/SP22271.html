<h1>PERIOD3 - Periodic function, trip 3</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Solar cycle predictions are used by various agencies and many industry groups. The solar cycle is important for determining the lifetime of satellites in low-Earth orbit, as the drag on the satellites correlates with the solar cycle \[...\].
