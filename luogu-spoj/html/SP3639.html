<h1>LUCKYNUM - Lucky Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/LUCKYNUM/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/LUCKYNUM/vn/)In some Asian countries, 8 and 6 are considered lucky digits. Any number containing only 8s and 6s is considered lucky number, e.g. 6, 8, 66, 668, 88, 886 …. Nguyen is a student who likes mathematics very much. Nguyen likes lucky numbers but only of the form
S = 8…86…6
where S has at least one digit and the number of 8s or 6s can be zero. Examples of S are 8, 88, 6, 66, 86, 886, 8866 …
Given a positive integer X (1 < X < 10 000), Nguyen wants to find the smallest lucky number S which has at most 200 digits and is divisible by X.
Your task is to write a program to find that number for Nguyen.</div>
