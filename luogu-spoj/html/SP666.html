<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目大意
给一个n个节点和n−1条边的树，现在要在一些节点放置灯最终点亮所有的边。
当一个节点上放置了一盏灯时，所有与它相连的边都会被点亮，且每一条边只需一个端点被点亮即认为被点亮。
试求最少的放灯数量和当放灯数量最少时的方案数。请将方案数结果模10007输出。
**数据范围：n≤100010**
## 输入输出格式：
###输入格式：
在文件的第一行，一个整数t(t<=20)，表示该测试点中有t组测试数据
接下来若干行描述每个测试数据中树的情况
首先包含一个n,代表这个测试数据中树的节点个数
接下来n-1行，每一行有两个整数x,y，代表有一条双向边连接着两个节点x和y
## 输出格式:
对于每一个测试数据，请输出最少的放灯数量和当放灯数量最少时的方案数。请将方案数结果模10007输出。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> The city of **Y-O** is a network of two-way streets and junctions with the following properties:
1. There is no more than one street between each pair of junctions.
2. Every junction is connected to every other junction either directly via a street or through other junctions by a unique path.
3. When a light is placed at a junction, all the streets meeting at this junction are also lit.
A valid lighting is a set of junctions such that if lights were placed at these, all the streets would be lit. An optimal lighting is a valid lighting such that it contains the least number of junctions.
The task is divided into two subtasks:
1. Find the number of lights in an optimal lighting.
2. Find the total number of such optimal lightings in the city.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>- The first line of the input contains a positive integer **t <= 20**, denoting the number of test cases.
- The description of the test cases follows one after the other.
- **Network Description:**
- The first line of description of a network consists of a positive integer **n <= 100010** denoting the number of junctions in the network.
- Each junction is numbered with a unique integer between **1** and **n**.
- The following **n-1** lines contain a pair of integers **u v (1 <= u,v <= n)** separated by a single space denoting that there is a street between junction **u** and junction **v**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The output must consist of **t** lines, the **k $ ^{th} $** line corresponding to the **k $ ^{th} $** network; **(1 <= k <= t)**. The **k $ ^{th} $** line must contain two integers separated by a single space. The first integer on the **k $ ^{th} $** line must be the number of junctions in an optimal lighting of network **k**. The second integer must be **N%10007**, which is the remainder left by the number of optimal lightings when divided by **10007**.</div>
