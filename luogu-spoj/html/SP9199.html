<h1>SPEED - Circular Track</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>两个人（A、B）在一条环形轨道上无限期地朝同一方向或相反方向奔跑。它们的速度是s1、s2。记顺时针方向为正，逆时针方向为负。输出A、B二人在圆上相遇的点的数目。
第一行包含测试组数t。每个测试用例包含两个整数，A、B两人的速度s1和s2（s1，s2<>0且s1<>s2）
数据范围：-2^31<s1，s2<2^31-1。 对每一次询问输出一行，他们相遇的不同点的数目。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Two persons are running on a circular track either in the same direction or in the opposite direction, indefinitely. The speed of both of them is given to you. Speed will be positive in clockwise direction, and negative in anticlockwise direction. Print the number of distinct points, at which they will meet on the circle.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> First line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers, S1 and S2 (not equal to zero) which are the speeds of the two persons. S1 and S2 will be distinct.
**Edited**: All the numbers fit in signed 32-bit integer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print in a separate line, the number of distinct points at which they meet.</div>
