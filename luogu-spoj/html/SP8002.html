<h1>HORRIBLE - Horrible Queries</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有$N$个数，每个数初始都是$0$，一共有$C$次操作，每种操作形如：
1. `0 p q v`表示将区间$[p,q]$中每个数都加上$v$；
2. `1 p q`表示输出区间$[p,q]$中每个数相加的和。
输入共$T$组数据。
每组数据中：
$N \leq 10^5$，$C \leq 10^5$，$1 \leq p, q \leq N$，$1 \leq v \leq 10^7$.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>World is getting more evil and it's getting tougher to get into the Evil League of Evil. Since the legendary Bad Horse has retired, now you have to correctly answer the evil questions of Dr. Horrible, who has a PhD in horribleness (but not in Computer Science). You are given an array of **N** elements, which are initially all 0. After that you will be given **C** commands. They are -
\* **0 p q v** - you have to add **v** to all numbers in the range of **p** to **q** (inclusive), where **p** and **q** are two indexes of the array.
\* **1 p q** - output a line containing a single integer which is the sum of all the array elements between **p** and **q** (inclusive)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line you'll be given **T**, number of test cases.
Each test case will start with **N** (**N** <= 100 000) and **C** (**C** <= 100 000). After that you'll be given **C** commands in the format as mentioned above. 1 <= **p**, **q** <= **N** and 1 <= **v** <= 10^7.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the answers of the queries.</div>
