<h1>YOKOC - Cubic Eight-Puzzle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's play a puzzle using eight cubes placed on a 3 x 3 board leaving one empty square.
Faces of cubes are painted with three colors. As a puzzle step, you can roll one of the cubes to the adjacent empty square. Your goal is to make the specified color pattern visible from above by a number of such steps.
The rules of this puzzle are as follows.
1. **Coloring of Cubes:** All the cubes are colored in the same way as shown in Figure 3. The opposite faces have the same color. ![\epsfbox{p3618a.eps}](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP7583/3b2e926103faebfe15c2217f4bad20860463674e.png)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input is a sequence of datasets. The end of the input is indicated by a line containing two zeros separated by a space. The number of datasets is less than 16. Each dataset is formatted as follows.
> _x_ _y_ _F_ $ _{11} $ _F_ $ _{21} $ _F_ $ _{31} $ _F_ $ _{12} $ _F_ $ _{22} $ _F_ $ _{32} $ _F_ $ _{13} $ _F_ $ _{23} $ _F_ $ _{33} $
The first line contains two integers _x_ and _y_ separated by a space, indicating the position (_x_, _y_) of the initially empty square. The values of _x_ and _y_ are 1, 2, or 3.
The following three lines specify the color pattern to make. Each line contains three characters _F_ $ _{1j} $ , _F_ $ _{2j} $ , and _F_ $ _{3j} $ , separated by a space. Character _F_ $ _{ij} $ indicates the top color of the cube, if any, at position (_i_, _j_) as follows:
B: Blue, W: White, R: Red, E: the square is Empty. There is exactly one `E' character in each dataset.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each dataset, output the minimum number of steps to achieve the goal, when the goal can be reached within 30 steps. Otherwise, output ``-1'' for the dataset.</div>
