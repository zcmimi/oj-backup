<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在一条直线上有n件珠宝，已知每件珠宝的位置，并且第 i 件珠宝在 ti 时刻就消失，问能否将所有的珠宝收集起来？如果能，求出最短时间。搜集能瞬间完成。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alibaba the famous character of our childhood stories would like to be immortal in order to keep bringing happiness to children. In order to reach this status he needs to prove that he is still able to do some unusual things. There are **n** treasures, (**n** <= 10000) each in a different place located along a straight road. Each treasure has a time limit, after that it vanishes. Alibaba must take all the **n** treasures, and he must do it quickly. So he needs to figure out the order in which he should take the treasures before their deadlines starting from the most favorable position. Alibaba has the list of places and deadlines of the treasures. A place **i** is located at distance **d $ _{i} $** from the leftmost end of the road. The time it takes to take a treasure is instantaneous.
Alibaba must find **the smallest time** by which he can take all the treasures.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input contains an integer **K** <= 10 - determining the number of datasets
