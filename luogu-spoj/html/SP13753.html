<h1>APS - Amazing Prime Sequence</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Bablu非常喜欢序列
他按照以下方式设计了自己的序列
a [0] = a [1] = 0
对于n> 1，a [n] = a [n-1] + f（n），其中f（n）是n的最小素因子。
他也非常喜欢编程，因此制作了一个小程序来找到a[n]，但由于他不擅长编程。所以，他请你帮忙找到一个a[n]
输入输出格式
输入格式：
第一行输入包含T（<= 100），即测试用例的数量。
接下来的T行包含单个数字n.（1 <n <10 ^ 7）。 输出格式： 单行包含每个测试用例的a[n]。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bablu is very fond of Series and Sequences...
After studying Fibonacci Series in Class IX, he was impressed and he designed his own sequence as follows...
a\[0\] = a\[1\] = 0
For n > 1, a\[n\] = a\[n - 1\] + f(n), where f(n) is smallest prime factor of n.
He is also very fond of programming and thus made a small program to find a\[n\], but since he is in Class IX, he is not very good at programming. So, he asks you for help. Your task is to find a\[n\] for the above sequence....</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your code will be checked for multiple Test Cases.
First Line of Input contains T (<= 100), the number of Test Cases.
Next T lines contain a single number N. (1 < N < 10^7).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Single line containing a\[n\] i.e. nth number of the sequence for each test case.</div>
