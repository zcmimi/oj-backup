<h1>TAP2012A - Awari 2</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>_\[The original version of this problem (in Spanish) can be found at <http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/taip2012-problems.pdf>\]_
Awari is a one-player game from the Antilles, which is played with boxes and stones instead of cards. A particular variant of Awari is played with **N** boxes numbered from **1** to **N**, each containing at the beginning of the game zero or more stones. The rules of this game are very simple, because there is only one type of valid move, consisting of choosing a box numbered **i** containing exactly **i** stones, and then taking those stones from the box in order to use them to add a single stone to every box numbered **1** through **i-1**; the remaining stone is then kept by the player. These moves are applied in succession as long as there exists a box **i** containing exactly **i** stones. When this is no longer true, the game ends. The player wins if at this stage every box is empty, and looses otherwise.
In the following figure, on the left hand side there is a possible initial state of a game with **N = 5** boxes (the circles) containing **P $ _{1} $ = 0**, **P $ _{2} $ = 1**, **P $ _{3} $ = 3**, **P $ _{4} $ = 0** and **P $ _{5} $ = 2** stones (the black dots). If box number **3**, containing **P $ _{3} $ = 3** stones, was chosen to make the next move, then the resulting configuration would be the one shown on the right hand side of the figure. Additionally, the player would now have one stone in his power.

Given the initial state of the boxes, you should determine if it is possible to win the game, that is, if there is a sequence of valid moves after which all the boxes are left empty.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each test case is described using two lines. The first line contains an integer **N**, indicating the number of boxes (**1 **). The second line contains **N** integer numbers **P $ _{i} $** , representing the number of stones in the boxes at the beginning of the game, from box **1** to box **N** in that order (0 ****P\_i** ****500** for **i = 1, ..., N**). In every test case there is at least one non-empty box, that is there exists **i** from **1** to **N** such that **P $ _{i&nbsp;} $ ≠ 0**. The end of the input is signalled by a line containing the number **-1**.********</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you should print a single line containing a single character. This character should be the uppercase letter **'S'** if it is possible to win the game; otherwise, it should be the uppercase letter **'N'**.
Awari is played with N boxes numbered from 1 to N, each</div>
