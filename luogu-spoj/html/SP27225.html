<h1>KNMOVE - Knight Move</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Daniel is a chess player. At his free time, he usually plays chess with his family or his friends. But, sometimes they have their own activities, so Daniel can't play chess. He spends his time to learn about knight's move. He has 1,000 x 1,000 chessboard, numbered from 1 to 1,000. He wants to move his knight from (a,b) to (1,1) with minimum movement. Help Daniel to solve it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input file consists of several lines.
The first line contains a single number t representing the number of question Daniel asked. \[ 1<=t<=1,000 \]
The next t lines contains a and b representing knight's position on the chessboard. \[ 1<= a,b <= 1,000 \]</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output file should contains t lines.
The i-th line should contain one number – the minimum number of knight's movement.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2\n3 5\n7 4\n\n</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2\n3\n&amp;nbsp;</code></pre>
<h2>说明</h2>
<div>题目： 丹尼奥是一名棋手。他喜欢在空闲时间里和家人朋友们下棋。 但有时他们要去参加自己的活动，所以不能陪他下棋。 这时他会研究马的移动问题。
他有一个1000*1000的棋盘，编号1~1000。 他想用最少的步数从(a,b)走到(1,1)。 因为数学不好，所以他求助于你。请你帮助他解决这个问题。
输入： 输入包含多组数据。 第一行，输入一个t,表示有t个起点(a,b)。(1<=t<=1000) 接下来每行两个数a和b，表示每个询问(a,b)。
输出： 对于每个(a,b)，输出一个数，表示最少步数。
注意：马走日。</div>
