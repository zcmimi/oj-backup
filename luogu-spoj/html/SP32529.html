<h1>NNS - Nearest Neighbor Search</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given N (N <= 100 000) d-dimensional (1 <= d <= 5) points, each having integer coordinates (X1, X2, ..., Xd). Then Q (Q <= 100 000) queries follow. For each query you are given a d-dimensional point (not necessarily from the given N) and you are to find the squared Euclidean distance to the closest point from the given N.
The coordinates of all N+Q points are generated randomly between -1 000 000 000 and 1 000 000 000.
The squred Euclidean distance between two points A and B is the sum of (A.Xi-B.Xi)\*(A.Xi-B.Xi) for i=1, 2, ..., d.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three numbers - N, d and Q.
The next N lines contain d integers each - the coordinates of a point.
The next Q lines contain d integers each - the coordinates of a query point.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the answer for each of the Q queries on separate lines.</div>
