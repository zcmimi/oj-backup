<h1>REVSEQ - Reverse the Sequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This is a very ad-hoc problem. Consider a sequence (N, N-1, ..., 2, 1). You have to reverse it, that is, make it become (1, 2, ..., N-1, N). And how do you do this? By making operations of the following kind.
Writing three natural numbers A, B, C such that 1
This means that you can pick any two adjacent blocks (each of an arbitrary length) and swap them. The problem can easily be solved in N-1 operations, but to make it more difficult, you must think of a faster way.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
