<h1>CODHASH - Hashcodes and primes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are n cards arranged in a row.The rth card from the left has rth prime number written on it on one side the other side is blank.Some cards have the blank side up and the others have the number side up.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains 0<T<=1000 (T-number of test cases) The first line of every test case contains two integers n and m where n is the number of cards on the table and m is the number of 1-cards on the table, (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For every test case print in a separate line the number of distinct hash codes that can be generated for the given arrangement of cards modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).</div>
