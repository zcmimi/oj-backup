<h1>SPCO - Gopu and Counting Bitwise Prime Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A positive integer is said to be Bit-sum-prime if the sum of all the bits in</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T : number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 10^5)
For next T lines, each test case contains two space seperated integers a and b. (a <= b). 1 <= a, b <= 10^19.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print the number of bitwise prime numbers between a and b (inclusive).</div>
