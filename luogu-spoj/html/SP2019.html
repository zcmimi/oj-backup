<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Rolling Ball
<a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Problem</a>
---------------------------------------------------
A solid spherical ball of radius **R** rolls without slipping on the inside surface of a fixed cone, whose tip points downward. The half-angle at the vertex of the cone is **u**. Initial conditions have been set up so that the ball travels around the cone in a horizontal circle of radius **l>R**, with the points on the ball that touch the cone tracing out a circle on the ball. Determine the radius of the circle of these contact points, if you want the sphere to travel around the cone as fast as possible.
<a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</a>
-----------------------------------------------------
Each line of input has integers **l** (R < l <= 1000000) **R** (0 < R <= 1000) and **u** (0 < u < 90) given in degrees.
<a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</a>
------------------------------------------------------
For each line of input, output the radius of the circle of the contact points, round to integer.
