<h1>ZZPERM - Zig-Zag Permutation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the following we will deal with nonempty words consists only of lower case letters 'a','b',..., 'j' and we will use the natural 'a' < 'b' < ... < 'j' ordering. Your task is to write a program that generates almost all zig-zag words (zig-zag permutations) from a given collection of letters. We say that a word W=W(1)W(2)...W(n) is zig-zag iff n = 1 or W(i) > W(i+1) and W(j) < W(j+1) for all odd 0 < i < n and for all even 0 < j < n or W(i) > W(i+1) and W(j) < W(j+1) for all even 0 < i < n and for all odd 0 < j < n. For example: "aabcc" is not zig-zag, "acacb" is zig-zag, "cac" is zig-zag, "abababc" is not zig-zag. If you imagine all possible zig-zag permutations of a word in increasing lexicographic order, you can assign a serial number (rank) to each one. For example: the word "aabcc" generates the sequence: 1 <-> "acacb", 2 <-> "acbca", 3 <-> "bacac", 4 <-> "bcaca", 5 <-> "cabac", 6 <-> "cacab".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input file consists several test cases. Each case contains a word (W) not longer than 64 letters and one positive number (D). The letters of each word are in increasing order. Input terminated by EOF.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case in the input file, the output file must contain all of the zig-zag permutations of W whose zig-zag serial is divisible by D, in increasing lexicographic order - one word per line. In the next line you have to print the total number of zig-zag permutations of W. There is no case that produces more than 365 lines of output. Print an empty line after each case.</div>
