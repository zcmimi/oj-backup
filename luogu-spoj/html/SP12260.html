<h1>HARSHAD - Devlali Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Devlali numbers were an important coinage by Indian recreational mathemtician D. R. Kaprekar.
For any positive integer n, define d(n) as the sum of n and the digits of n. Eg, d(199) = 199 + 1 + 9 + 9 = 218.
For a positive number m, if there exists no positive number r such that d(r) = m, then m is a Devlali number. First few Devlali numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, ... so on.
A prime number falling in this family is called a Devlali Prime. First few Devlali Primes are 3, 5, 7, ... so on.</div>
