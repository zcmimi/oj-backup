<h1>DOMINOES - Dominoes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Johnny is playing with some dominoes one afternoon. His dominoes come in a variety of heights and colors.
Just like any other child, he likes to put them in a row and knock them over.
He wants to know something: how many pushes does it take to knock down all the dominoes?
Johnny is lazy, so he wants to minimize the number of pushes he takes.
A domino, once knocked over, will knock over any domino that it touches on the way down.
For the sake of simplicity, imagine the floor as a one-dimensional line, where 1 is the leftmost point. Dominoes will not slip along the floor once toppled. Also, dominoes do have some width: a domino of length 1 at position 1 can knock over a domino at position 2.
For the mathematically minded:
A domino at position _x_ with height _h_, once knocked over to the right, will knock all dominoes at positions _x_+1, _x_+2, ..., _x_+_h_ rightward as well.
Similarly, the same domino knocked over to the left will knock all dominoes at positions _x_-1, _x_-2, ..., _x_-_h_ leftward.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input starts with a single integer _N_ (_N_ N pairs of integers.
Each pair of integers represents the location and height of a domino, in that order (0 No two dominoes will have the same location.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer on a single line: the minimum number of pushes Johnny must make in order to ensure that all dominoes are knocked over.</div>
