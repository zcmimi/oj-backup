<h1>GRAPHCUT - Graph Cut</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a graph G, and a subset of its vertices X. The associated cut of X is the set of edges
associated to X is the subset of all edges in G such that exactly one of the two vertices it joins
belongs to X.
In thinks, you will be given a graph and a subset of its edges, and you will have to determine
whether there exists a subset of the vertices of the graph for which the given subset of the edges
is its associated cut.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (1 a line which contains three integers N (2 vertices in the graph, and the number of edges in the subset for which we want to know whether
it is an associated cut or not. Then, E lines follow, each of them contains two integers u,v (1 N) which are the vertices joined by the edge, the first K of these E lines represent the asked subset.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output T lines, one for each test case. If the asked subset is an associated cut, then print “YES”,
otherwise print “NO”.</div>
