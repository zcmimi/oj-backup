<h1>WACHOVIA - Wachovia Bank</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Danilo Gheyi is a renowned bank robber. He is known worldwide for accomplishing the most profitable bank robbery, in Fortaleza, Ceará. Danilo and his friends dug a tunnel to get into the main chest. There were some bags, with different amounts of money or jewelry and weight. They had to leave about 50% of the total value, since the truck couldn't carry all the bags.
Danilo wasn't caught, and to show that he can do itall again, he is planning a robbery to one of the safer banks in USA -the Wachovia Bank. He wants your help to maximize the amount stolen, avoiding a huge loss as it happened in Fortaleza.
