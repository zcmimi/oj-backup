<h1>VOL - Volunteers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>ACM ICPC World Finals 2009, sponsored by IBM and hosted by KTH, Royal Institute of Technology will be held in Stockholm, Sweden. This contest will last for _N_(1<= _N_ <= 1000) days. We need at least _A $ _{i} $_ volunteers in the _i_-th day. Now there are _M_(1<= _M_ <=10000) kind of volunteers. The _i_-th type of volunteers will work from _S $ _{i} $_ -th day to _T $ _{i} $_ -th day, we will pay them $_C $ _{i} $_ . Now your task is to minimize the money KTH pay for all the volunteers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Ten test cases(given one after another, you have to process all!). For each test case:
The first line contains two space-seperated integers _N_ and _M_. The second line contains N nonnegative integers _A $ _{i} $_ . _M_ lines follow, each contains three integers _S $ _{i} $_ , _T $ _{i} $_ and _C $ _{i} $_ . You may assume you can hire almost unlimited number of every type of volunteers.
_Tip_: During your calculation, **int** in C/C++/Java or **longint** in Pascal is enough.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case:
Output one line with an integer - the minimum cost.</div>
