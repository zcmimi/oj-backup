<h1>PHDISP - The Philosophical Dispute</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day, mathematician and philosopher were engaged in a heated dispute.
Philosopher said:
\- Ideal line has only length and no width, therefore, no line can have an area.
Mathematician replied:
\- That's as it may be, but still you can ll a square with a line in such a way that there will be no gaps.
And you can't deny that a square has an area, and he grinned.
But Philosopher still wasn't convinced:
\- Show me this line, then.
\- With pleasure... - responded Mathematician and scribbled some equations on a piece of paper:

\- With t increasing, the point (x, y) will move around the square, forming a line.
\- So what? - asked Philosopher. How is it going to ll the entire square?
\- Indeed, it will, - said Mathematician, - Whichever point inside the square you draw, the line will eventually cross that point.
\- No, - replied Philosopher indignantly, - Anyway, I don't believe. When will the line cross this point? - and he put a thick dot inside the square.
Give Philosopher an answer.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>_t_ – number of tests \[_t_ <= 150\], than t test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the coordinates (x0, y0) of the dot center (-1 <= x0, y0 <= 1). The second line contains eps <= 0.0001 - the radius of the dot (the dot is essentially a small circle).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output any value of t in the segment \[0, 10^12\], which corresponds to the line crossing the dot, or "FAIL", if the line doesn't cross the dot.</div>
