<h1>BACKPACK - Dab of Backpack</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一天，蓝玛丽去附近的超市买东西。她有一个背包，容量是v-max。她发现市场上有许多商品，每个都有一卷v{i}。
（它总是10的倍数，小于10000）和重要性c{i}
（1<=C{I}<=5）。由于她几乎拥有无限的金钱，她唯一要解决的问题是如何选择商品，使总体积不会超过背包的容量，并且体积和每件商品的重要性的乘积之和是最大的。为了成为一名优秀的数学家，她很快就想出了答案，现在她想让你做一个更难的任务。有两种货物：主要货物和附件。如果你想买一个附件，你必须先买它的主要商品。
多个测试用例，它们的数量在第一行给出。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day Blue Mary goes to a nearby supermarket to buy some goods. She has a backpack, whose capacity is _V-Max_. She finds that there are many goods in the market, each has a volume _V $ _{i} $_ (it will always be a multiple of 10 and less than 10000) and an importance _C $ _{i} $_ (1<= _C $ _{i} $_ <=5). Since she has almost unlimited money, the only problem she is to solve is how to choose goods such that the total volume won't exceed the capacity of the backpack and the sum of the product of the volume and the importance of each good is maximum. To be an excellent mathematician, she comes up with the answer quickly, and now she wants you to do a harder task. There are two kinds of goods: main goods and attachments. If you want to buy an attachment you must buy its main good before.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases, the number of them is given in the very first line.
For each test case:
The first line contains two space-separated integers _V-Max_ (1<=_V-Max_<=32000) and the number of the goods _N_ (1<=_N_<=60). N lines follow, each contains three space-separated integers _V $ _{i} $_ , _C $ _{i} $_ and a integer _u_. If _u_ is not 0, this good is an attachment of good _u_(as the order in the input file).
To make the problem not too difficult, Blue Mary tells you that:
(A) An attachment won't have any attachments which belong to it.
(B) A main good will always have less than 3 attachments.</div>
