<h1>EGCJPURE - Your Rank is Pure (EXTREME ver)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Note: The problem description is same as [GCJPURE](../GCJPURE/ "GCJPURE"), but with more higher constraints (to become more challenging), more strict time limit (to reject bad complexity), and more strict source limit (to reject hardcoded precomputation). Good Luck.
### Problem Description
