<h1>HARSTR - TWO STRINGS</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two strings _a_ and _b_. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string _b_ in such a way that it becomes a[submultiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset)of string _a_. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from _b_ and make it empty.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains string _a_, and the second line — string _b_. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 105 characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line output a submultiset of string _a_ in **sorted** order , obtained from _b_. If multiple answer exists , output [lexicographically smallest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order)[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order)
If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).</div>
