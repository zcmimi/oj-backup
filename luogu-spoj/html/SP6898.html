<h1>SUB_PROB - Substring Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>String Matching is an important problem in computer science research and finds applications in Bioinformatics, Data mining,pattern recognition, Internet security and many more areas.
The problem we consider here is a smaller version of it. You are given a string M and N other strings smaller in length than M. You have to find whether each of these N strings is a substring of M. All strings consist of only alphanumeric characters.
You are required to write a C/CPP code to solve the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input to the program consists of a series of lines. The first line contains the string M (no more than **100000** characters long). The next line contains an integer N (<**1000**) the number of query strings. Each of the next N lines contain a string S (each of which is no more than **2000** characters long).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output should consist of N lines each with a character 'Y'/'N' indicating whether the string S is a substring of String M or not.</div>
