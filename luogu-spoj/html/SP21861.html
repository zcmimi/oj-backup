He gave them a string of size S which consists of only small English letters. According to Priyun some of the alphabets are “Nice” and rest all are “Eww”. Now Priyun has a tolerance level of X “Eww”.
Priyun wants to know the distinct substrings of the given string which he can tolerate.
Even Sacchi and Maurya is finding it difficult to solve. So help them.</div>
