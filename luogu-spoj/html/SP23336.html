<h1>TRNGL - Make Triangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Chayanika loves Mathematics. She is learning a new chapter geometry. While reading the chapter a question came in her mind. Given a convex polygon of n sides. In how many ways she can break it into triangles, by cutting it with (n-3) non-adjacent diagonals and the diagonals do not intersect.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the input will be an integer t (1<=t<=100000) which is the no of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer n (3<=n<=1000) which is the size of the polygon.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output the no of ways %100007.</div>
