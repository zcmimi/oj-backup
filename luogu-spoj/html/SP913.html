<h1>QTREE2 - Query on a tree II</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
给定一棵n个点的树，边具有边权。要求作以下操作：
DIST a b 询问点a至点b路径上的边权之和
KTH a b k 询问点a至点b有向路径上的第k个点的编号
有多组测试数据，每组数据以DONE结尾。
感谢@vegacx 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given a tree (an undirected acyclic connected graph) with **N** nodes, and edges numbered 1, 2, 3...**N**-1. Each edge has an integer value assigned to it, representing its length.
We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:
- **DIST a b** : ask for the distance between node **a** and node **b**
or
- **KTH a b k** : ask for the **k**-th node on the path from node **a** to node **b**
**Example:**
**N** = 6
1 2 1 // edge connects node 1 and node 2 has cost 1
2 4 1
2 5 2
1 3 1
3 6 2
Path from node 4 to node 6 is 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6
**DIST 4 6** : answer is 5 (1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5)
**KTH 4 6 4** : answer is 3 (the 4-th node on the path from node 4 to node 6 is 3)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input contains an integer **t**, the number of test cases (**t** <= 25). **t** test cases follow.
For each test case:
- In the first line there is an integer **N** (**N** <= 10000)
- In the next **N**-1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with three integers **a b c** denotes an edge between **a**, **b** of cost **c** (**c** <= 100000)
- The next lines contain instructions **"DIST a b"** or **"KTH a b k"**
- The end of each test case is signified by the string "**DONE**".
There is one blank line between successive tests.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each **"DIST"** or **"KTH"** operation, write one integer representing its result.
Print one blank line after each test.</div>
