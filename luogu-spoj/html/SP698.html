<h1>PLHOP - Plane Hopping</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This man has grown so rich that, when he travels between any two locations he always takes atleast K flights. In a region of N cities, we need to find the minimal cost required for the man to travel between every pair of cities. There are provisions (especially for this type of rich men,) to fly from i-th city to the i-th city itself!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> T – The number of test cases.
In each test case :
K N
NxN matrix representing the costs of the tickets. The i-th line, j-th column’s entry represents the cost of a ticket from city i to city j. The numbers are of course space separated.
**Constraints :**
T<=20
N<=50
K<=10 $ ^{9} $
The cost of each ticket <= 100
Each element of the output matrix will fit into a 64-bit integer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For the i-th test case , 1st line is of the form “Region #i:”.
In the following N lines, output an NxN matrix where the j-th element of the i-th line represents the minimal cost to travel from city i to city j with taking atleast K flights. The numbers on a line must be separated by atleast one space. Output a blank line after each testcase (including the last one).</div>
