<h1>PALDR - Even Palindrome</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [Vietnamese](/problems/PALDR/vn/) [English](/problems/PALDR/en/)Palindrome is a string that has the property of reading the same in either direction (left to right or right to left). You are to determine whether a given string can be expressed as a concatenation of palindromes of even length.
Note: A string can be formed by concatenation of any number of even palindrome strings.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains **T** (T < 100), the number of test cases. **T** lines follow, each containing the string corresponding to that particular test case.
**Note:**
There might be a new-line character (i.e. '\\r' in C++) at the end of each line. Be careful with your languages.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output consists of **T** lines, one corresponding to each test case. You should output _YES_ if the string can be expressed as concatination of even length palindromes and _NO_ otherwise.</div>
