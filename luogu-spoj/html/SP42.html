<h1>ADDREV - Adding Reversed Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
传统喜剧演员喜欢喜剧而不喜欢悲剧。不幸的是，大多数古代戏剧都是悲剧。因此acm的戏剧顾问决定把一些悲剧变成喜剧。显然，这项工作是非常困难的，因为剧本的基本意义必须保持完整，尽管所有的事情都会发生变化。例如数字：如果悲剧中出现了任何数字，在被接受为即将到来的数字之前，必须将其转换成相反的形式.
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入包括n个用例（小于等于10000个）。输入的第一行只包含正整数n。这些是你要添加的反向数字。每种情况下都由一条直线和两个由空格分隔的正整数组成。这些是你要加的反向数字。
输出格式：
对于每个情况，只打印一行包含一个整数——两个反向数字的反和。省略输出中的任何前导零。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Antique Comedians of Malidinesia prefer comedies to tragedies. Unfortunately, most of the ancient plays are tragedies. Therefore the dramatic advisor of ACM has decided to transfigure some tragedies into comedies. Obviously, this work is very hard because the basic sense of the play must be kept intact, although all the things change to their opposites. For example the numbers: if any number appears in the tragedy, it must be converted to its reversed form before being accepted into the comedy play.
Reversed number is a number written in arabic numerals but the order of digits is reversed. The first digit becomes last and vice versa. For example, if the main hero had 1245 strawberries in the tragedy, he has 5421 of them now. Note that all the leading zeros are omitted. That means if the number ends with a zero, the zero is lost by reversing (e.g. 1200 gives 21). Also note that the reversed number never has any trailing zeros.
ACM needs to calculate with reversed numbers. Your task is to add two reversed numbers and output their reversed sum. Of course, the result is not unique because any particular number is a reversed form of several numbers (e.g. 21 could be 12, 120 or 1200 before reversing). Thus we must assume that no zeros were lost by reversing (e.g. assume that the original number was 12).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of N cases (equal to about 10000). The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly one line with two positive integers separated by space. These are the reversed numbers you are to add.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case, print exactly one line containing only one integer - the reversed sum of two reversed numbers. Omit any leading zeros in the output.</div>
