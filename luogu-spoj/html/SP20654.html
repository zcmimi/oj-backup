<h1>INTSUB - Interesting Subset</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, … , 2n-1, 2n} where n is an integer. You have to find the number of interesting subsets of this set X.
A subset of set X is interesting if there are at least two integers a & b such that b is a multiple of a, i.e. remainder of b divides by a is zero and a is the smallest number in the set.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input file contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input is an integer T(<=30) denoting the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains an integer 'n' where 1<=n<=1000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you have to output as the format below:
Case X: Y
Here X is the test case number and Y is the number of subsets. As the number Y can be very large, you need to output the number modulo 1000000007.</div>
