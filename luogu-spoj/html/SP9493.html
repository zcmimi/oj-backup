<h1>ADFRUITS - Advanced Fruits</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>“21世纪水果”公司专注于通过将基因从一种水果转移到另一种水果的基因组中来创造新的水果。大多数情况下，这种方法不起作用，但有时候，在非常罕见的情况下，会出现一种新的水果，它们的味道就像两者之间的混合物。
公司内部讨论的一个重要话题是“如何召集新作品？” 苹果和梨之间的混合物当然可以称为苹果梨，但这听起来并不是很有趣。老板最终决定使用包含原始水果名称的最短字符串作为子字符串作为新名称。例如，“applear”包含“apple”和“pear”（APPLEar和apPlEAR），并且没有具有相同属性的较短字符串。
因此，蔓越莓和波森莓的组合将被称为“boysecranberry”或“craboysenberry”。
你的工作是编写一个程序，为两个给定的水果组合计算这么短的名字。您的算法应该是高效的，否则它不太可能在分配时间长的水果名称中执行。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The company "21st Century Fruits" has specialized in creating new sorts of fruits by transferring genes from one fruit into the genome of another one. Most times this method doesn't work, but sometimes, in very rare cases, a new fruit emerges that tastes like a mixture between both of them.
A big topic of discussion inside the company is "How should the new creations be called?" A mixture between an apple and a pear could be called an apple-pear, of course, but this doesn't sound very interesting. The boss finally decides to use the shortest string that contains both names of the original fruits as sub-strings as the new name. For instance, "applear" contains "apple" and "pear" (APPLEar and apPlEAR), and there is no shorter string that has the same property.
A combination of a cranberry and a boysenberry would therefore be called a "boysecranberry" or a "craboysenberry", for example.
Your job is to write a program that computes such a shortest name for a combination of two given fruits. Your algorithm should be efficient, otherwise it is unlikely that it will execute in the alloted time for long fruit names.</div>
