<h1>AXIS - Axis of Symmetry</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a point p and a line L on the plane, the reflection of p against L is a point q such that
the segment pq is perpendicular to L and its middle point is on L. If p is on L, then p = q.
Given a set of points on the plane, an axis of symmetry is a line on the plane such that the
reflection of any point of the set against that line gives a point of the set.
In this problem you are given a set of points on the plane, and you must decide whether there
exists at least one axis of symmetry or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several test cases, each one described in several lines. The first line of each
test case contains an integer N indicating the number of points in the set (3 Each of the next N lines describes a different point of the set using two integers X and Y
separated by a single space (−2000 of the point in the XY plane. You may assume that no two points of each test case have the
same location. The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should not be processed as
a test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a single line with an uppercase “Y” if there exists at least one axis of
symmetry for the provided set of points, or an uppercase “N” otherwise.</div>
