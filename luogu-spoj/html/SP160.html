<h1>PALSEC - Choosing a Palindromic Sequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two sequences of words: X=(x $ _{1} $ ,...,x $ _{n} $ ) and Y=(y $ _{1} $ ,...,y $ _{n} $ ), determine how many binary sequences P=(p $ _{1} $ ,...,p $ _{n} $ ) exist, such that the word concatenation z $ _{1} $ z $ _{2} $ ...z $ _{n} $ , where z $ _{i} $ =x $ _{i} $ iff p $ _{i} $ =1 and z $ _{i} $ =y $ _{i} $ iff p $ _{i} $ =0, is a palindrome (a word which is the same when read from left to right and from right to left).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case the first line contains the positive integer n - the number of words in a sequence (1<=n<=30). The following n lines contain consecutive words of the sequence X, one word per line. The next n lines contain consecutive words of the sequence Y, one word per line. Words consist of lower case letters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z'), are non-empty, and not longer than 400 characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case output one line containing a single integer - the number of different possible sequences P.</div>
