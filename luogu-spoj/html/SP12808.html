<h1>TREEII - Yet-Yet Another Counting Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Count the number of rooted trees with n nodes, which satiesfy the following condition:
If the distance between node A and the root equals to the distance between node B and the root, then A and B must have same number of (direct) children.
Two trees are considered identical if and only if there's a bijection of n nodes which transforms one tree into another one.
Since the answer can be very large, output the answer modules 1000000007.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1<=n<=1000). Process until EOF is reached.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
