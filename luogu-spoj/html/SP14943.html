<h1>DRTREE - Dynamically-Rooted Tree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given a rooted tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. Initially node 1 is the root. Each node i has a weight W\[i\]. You have to perform two types of operations:
**"S a"** - Find the sum of weights of node **a**'s sub-tree nodes (including node **a**).
**"R a"** - Change root of the tree to **a**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> **Line 1:** N (1 <= N <= 10 $ ^{5} $ ), number of nodes.
**Line 2:** N space-separated integers, weights of nodes from 1 to N. **i**'th integer is W\[i\] (1 <= W\[i\] <= 10 $ ^{9} $ ).
**Line 3:** N-1 space-separated integers, **i**'th integer is the parent of node **i+1**.
**Line 4:** Q, the number of operations (1 <= Q <= 10 $ ^{5} $ ).
**Lines 5 .. 5+Q-1:** Every line contains a space separated character and an integer. Character describes the type of the operation, and integer is the node number.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each operation of type 'S', output the operations result in a separate line.</div>
