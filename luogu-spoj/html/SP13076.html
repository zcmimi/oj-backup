<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
邪恶的卡克特斯要淹没魔法森林！为了防止被淹，潘特要以最快的速度返回到家里。魔法森林是一个R行C列的地形图，‘.’表示空地，‘*’代表已经被水淹没，‘X’表示岩石，而‘D’代表潘特的家，‘S’表示潘特的所在地。
每一分钟，潘特可以向上下左右四个相邻区域转移。每一分钟，水也会继续蔓延，对于某块空地，只要有一条边与水淹没区域有公共边就会在一分钟内被淹没。潘特和水都不可以穿过岩石，潘特也不可以涉水。最重要的是，潘特的家是永远都不会被淹没的。
写一个程序，对于给定的魔法森林的地图，输出潘特安全返家所需要的最短的时间
Note: 潘特不能移动到即将被淹没的区域（同一分钟）。
输入
第一行，包含两个整数 R ， C（均<=50）
接下来R行，每行包含C个字符 ('.', '*', 'X', 'D' or 'S'，地图中仅有一个'D'和'S').
输出
输出安全返家所需要的最短时间. 如果不可能安全返家则输出“KAKTUS”.
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The evil emperor Cactus has in his possession the Magic Keg and has flooded the Enchanted
Forest! The Painter and the three little hedgehogs now have to return to the Beaver's den where they
will be safe from the water as quickly as possible!
The map of the Enchanted Forest consists of R rows and C columns. Empty fields are represented
by '.' characters, flooded fields by '\*' and rocks by 'X'. Additionally, the Beaver's den is represented
by 'D' and the Painter and the three little hedgehogs are shown as 'S'.
Every minute the Painter and the three little hedgehogs can move to 4 neighbouring fields (up,
down, left or right). Every minute the flood expands as well so that all empty fields that have at least
one common side with a flooded field become flooded as well. Neither water nor the Painter and
the three little hedgehogs can pass through rocks. Naturally, the Painter and the three little
hedgehogs cannot pass through flooded fields, and water cannot flood the Beaver's den.
Write a program that will, given a map of the Enchanted Forest, output the shortest time needed
for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely reach the Beaver's den.
Note: The Painter and the three little hedgehogs cannot move into a field that is about to be
flooded (in the same minute).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input will contain two integers, R and C, smaller than or equal to 50.
The following R lines will each contain C characters ('.', '\*', 'X', 'D' or 'S'). The map will contain
exactly one 'D' character and exactly one 'S' character</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the shortest possible time needed for the Painter and the three little hedgehogs to safely
reach the Beaver's den. If this is impossible output the word “KAKTUS” on a line by itself.</div>
