<h1>DOJO - With a Pit of Death</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leo is training his martial arts in byteland's dojo.
The dojo is a rectangular ( n × m ) area with a pit of death, a square located at (i, j), where 1 <= i <= n, and 1 <= j <= m.
Every night, battles are very hard and the dojo is destructed, and reconstructed during the day around the pit.
Every evening, Leo's first mission is to make in place tatamis ( 2 × 1 ) in the new dojo.
Tatamis should cover the whole dojo except the pit of death.
Sometimes it's possible, sometimes not!</div>
