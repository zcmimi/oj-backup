<h1>SHELL - Shell game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述:
经典的转纸杯游戏。给定小球初始所在的纸杯位置和n次交换纸杯的操作，问你最后小球的位置。
但这就和真正的游戏一样！
要注意的是：最左边的杯子永远为"left"，中间的永远为"center"，最右边永远为"right"，不会随着交换而改变。
输入:
第一行一个字符串标识小球的初始位置("left"、"right"或"center");
第二行一个整数n(n不超过10)表示接下来的操作次数。
之后n行，每行两个字符串a、b（"left"、"right"或"center"）表示交换当前位置为a、b的纸杯。
输出:
一个整数，表示最后小球所在位置（"left"、"right"或"center"）
注意：
本题第十个点输入不合法。且仅此点输入中n=10。
如果实在想不明白，为什么看看前人的经验呢？（才不是看题解呢！）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Your program is to play the traditional "shell" game ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell\_game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_game "here")). The game is played as follows:
There is a person called an operator; he/she has 3 identical, non-transparent hollow objects - shells, and a metal ball, which he/she places under one of these objects. Then, the operator quickly swaps pairs of shells several times; if shells at positions A and B are swapped, and the ball is under the shell at position A, it moves under the shell at position B. In the end, you have to guess which shell the ball is under.
The shells are identical, and positions mean immediate position that you see (left will always denote the leftmost shell, not the shell that was leftmost in the beginning).
Input
The first line of input contains one string - "left", "center" or "right", denoting the position of the shell the ball is under in the beginning. The second line contains an integer N<=10, denoting the number of swaps. N lines follow, all of them contain 2 strings - positions of 2 shells which are swapped.
Output
Output position of the shell the ball is under after all swaps are performed.
Warning
Testing simulates the exact progress of an actual game! There are 10 testcases; in the last one only, N=10. You're likely to get a WA on this last test case, even if your program seems correct. Remember, it's like an actual game!
Example
```
Input:
left
2
left right
right center
Output:
center
Explanation:
in the beginning, the ball is under the left shell
after swap 1, it's under the right shell
after swap 2, it's under the center shell
