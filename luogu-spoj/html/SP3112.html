<h1>STSTRING - Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two strings A and B, we define the operator ĉ on {A,B} for string C as C ĉ {A,B}.
```
if length(A) < length(C) < length(B), then C satisfies the above operator.
else
if length(A)=length(C), then C must be lexicographically greater than A.
if length(B)=length(C), then C must be lexicographically smaller than B.
```</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Given two strings A,B with length(A) < = length(B) <= 6. A,B can contain any characters between A and J (capital letters).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of strings satisfying the above criteria. C must also satisfy criteria of A and B. Any two adjacent characters in string C may neither be the same nor consecutve (i.e. the absoulte difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters is greater than 1).</div>
