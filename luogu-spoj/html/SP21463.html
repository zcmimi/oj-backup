<h1>NPC2014H - Arithmetic Rectangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a matrix with size N x M where each cell contains an integer. An arithmetic rectangle is a rectangle inside the matrix so that each row and column is an arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression is a sequence so that each number minus the number before it is the same. Given a matrix, find the largest arithmetic rectangle, which is the arithmetic rectangle containing the most number of cells. For example, the largest arithmetic rectangles of the matrix below consists of 9 cells:
![5,3,5,7/2,4,4,4/3,5,3,1/6,3,2,4](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP21463/a34d30431667917a6cb5214e5dd22027d4956314.png)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input is T, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with N and M. The next N lines each containing M integers A $ _{ij} $ representing the value of each cell of the matrix. Each input file will not exceed 20 MB in size.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output the number of cells in the largest arithmetic rectangle in the matrix.</div>
