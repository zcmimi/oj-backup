<h1>DIFFV - Different Vectors </h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given set of **N** vectors, each vector consists of **K** integers. Vector ex equals ey **iff** there exist function bijection **f** and integer **r**, such that ex\[i\] = f( ey\[(i+r)%K\] ), for each i in range \[0, K> Eg. (1, 2, 2, 3) == (22, 3, 4, 22), with r=2 and f(22)=2, f(3)=3 and f(4)=1. But (22,3,22,4) is not equal to (1, 2, 2, 3).
How many different vectors are there in set of N given vectors ?
Constraints :
n <= 10000
k <= 100
vector values are from range \[0, 10^9\]</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
