<h1>GCDEX - GCD Extreme</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出n,求所有gcd(i,j)之和,其中1<=i<j<=n. 不超过20000组数据,n<=1000000. 感谢@Fuko_Ibuki 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given the value of N, you will have to find the value of G. The meaning of G is given in the following code
```
G=0;
for(i = 1 ; i < N ; i++)
for(j = i+1 ; j <= N ; j++)
G+=gcd(i,j);
```
Here gcd() is a function that finds the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input file contains at most 20000 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (1 < N < 1000001). The meaning of N is given in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of G for the corresponding N. The value of G will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
