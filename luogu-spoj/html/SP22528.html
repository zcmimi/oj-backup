<h1>CQM1TREE - Paths in a Tree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a tree and a set of edges **K**, find total number of distinct paths in the tree consisting of all the edges in **K**. Two paths are distinct if the end nodes of the paths are different. Also, a path like (1->2->3) is same as (3->2->1).
A path is defined as a series of edges which connect a sequence of vertices which are all distinct.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line denotes the number of test cases **T** (<=100)
**T** test cases follow.
Each Test case is defined as:
First line contains **n** (1<=n<=2\*10^4) and **k** (<=n-1) which are the number of nodes and size of the edge set, respectively.
n-1 lines follow, each defining an edge between pair of nodes **u** and **v**.
nodes are numbered 1 to n.
A single line consisting of **k** space separated indices (0-based, in order they appear in the input) of edges which are in the set.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct paths in the tree consisting of all the edges in the set.</div>
