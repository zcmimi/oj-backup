<h1>WINSTRAT - Winning Strategy</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/WINSTRAT/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/WINSTRAT/vn/) A table has n rows labeled by numbers from 0 to n-1 and n columns also labeled by numbers from 0 to n-1. The coordinate of a cell belonging to the ith row and jth column is (i,j). Each cell has a value of 0 or 1. In this table, there are m cells having the value of 0. The remaining cells in the table have the values of 1. Two players play a game by making moves in turn until no more moves can be made. The first player will make the move first. Each player can only make one move at each step. The player who cannot make a move loses and the other player wins the game. A legal move is an action to flip the value (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) of four cells at four corners of a rectangle inside the table which satisfies the following conditions:
- the rectangle is has more than 1 row and more than 1 column,
- the cell with the highest row-column coordinates among the four cells must have the value of 0.
- Given the values of cells in the table, your task is to write a program to help the first player to find a winning strategy so that he will win the game no matter how the other player plays.</div>
