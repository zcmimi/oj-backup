<h1>XC - Xavier is Learning to Count</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## **题目描述**
泽维尔是一个9岁的好学生，并且他喜欢玩各种各样的游戏。
他的其中最爱玩的一个游戏是:他让他的同学谢瑞尔手里拿着很多张卡片。谢瑞尔在每一张卡片上面写下一个正整数。不同卡片上的数字是不一样的。然后她写下一个方程，方程的右边是她选择的一个正整数，左边是p个整数的和:![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9687/3d9bbdf0e685b67ecd5d1d6f3635f5bbb5412121.png)
然后她让泽维尔把p张卡片放在相应的Xi上。i的位置使这个方程正确，并且保证Xi从小到大排序，即:![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9687/3732c5b0db8433a1ce502f2445282bcac9b4b6cc.png)
## **输入格式**
有多个测试点。它们的数量在输入的开头给出。
对于每个测试点:
第一行包含两个空格分隔的整数m和p (1<=p<=5)。
第二行包含m不同的正整数的数字写在每个卡片。（均不超过13000）
总共大约有120个测试用例，但是其中90%相对较小。更准确地说，在90%的测试用例中，所有数字都小于或等于100。
## **输出格式**
对于每个测试点:
对于每一个正整数，输出一行中的方案数。为了保证输出是有限的，应只输出具有正解的数。
在每个测试点之后输出一个空行。有关更多格式细节，请参见样例。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Xavier, a 9-year-old student, loves playing many kinds of puzzles. One of his favourites is the following:
Xerier, his classmate, has made many cards. She writes down a single positive number on each of them. No numbers written on different cards are the same. After that she writes down an equation, whose right side is a single positive number chosen by her, and the left side is the sum of p integers:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9687/3d9bbdf0e685b67ecd5d1d6f3635f5bbb5412121.png)
Then she asks Xavier put p cards on the corresponding X $ _{i} $ 's position to make this equation correct, **with an additional condition that X $ _{i} $ should be ordered from smaller to bigger**, i.e.

Every time Xavier immediately comes up with many solutions. Now he wants to know how many solutions in total are there for any n given by Xerier.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are multiple test cases. The number of them is given in the beginning of the input. Then a series of input block comes one by one.
For each test case:
The first line contains two space-separated integers m and p (1<=p<=5). The second line contains m distinct positive integers - the numbers written on each of the cards. None of these integers exceeds 13000.
There are about 120 test cases in total, but 90% of them are relatively small. More precisely, all numbers are less than or equal to 100 in 90% of the test cases.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case:
For each positive integer, output the number of ways in a single line. To keep the output finite, only numbers with positive ways should be outputted.
Output a blank line after each test case. See sample for more format details.</div>
