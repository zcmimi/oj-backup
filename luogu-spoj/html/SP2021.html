<h1>PEBBMOV - Moving Pebbles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有两个人在玩下面的游戏。在游戏开始时有$n(1\le n\le 100000)$堆石子。在游戏的每一步，玩家可以选择任意一堆石子并拿走至少一个石子，然后从这一堆中移动任意个（可以是0）石子到另一个还有石子的堆里，如果一个人无法进行操作就输了，请问是先手必胜还是后手必胜。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A Game of Moving Pebbles
<a name="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Problem</a>
---------------------------------------------------
Two players play the following game. At the beginning of the game they start with **n** (1<=**n**<=100000) piles of stones. At each step of the game, the player chooses a pile and remove at least one stone from this pile and move zero or more stones from this pile to any other pile that still has stones. A player loses if he has no more possible moves. Given the initial piles, determine who wins: the first player, or the second player, if both play perfectly.
<a name="SECTION0001003000000000000000">The Input</a>
-----------------------------------------------------
Each line of input has integers **0 < n <= 100000**, followed by **n** positive integers denoting the initial piles.
<a name="SECTION0001004000000000000000">The Output</a>
------------------------------------------------------
For each line of input, output "first player" if first player can force a win, or "second player", if the second player can force a win.
