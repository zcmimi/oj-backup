<h1>BFONP - Transform the Expression (Again!)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Have you solved [ONP](../ONP/ "Transform the Expression") problem? Especially using [brainf\*\*k](../../../ranks/ONP/lang=BF "Brainf**k")? This problem will give you extra points if you can solve [ONP](../ONP/ "Transform the Expression") using [brainf\*\*k](../../../ranks/ONP/lang=BF "Brainf**k"). Note that this problem has larger constraints.
The task is: "Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form (Reverse Polish Notation). Two-argument operators: +, -, \*, /, ^ (priority from the lowest to the highest), brackets ( ). Operands: only letters: a,b,...,z. Assume that there is only one RPN form (no expressions like a\*b\*c)."</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>t \[the number of expressions
