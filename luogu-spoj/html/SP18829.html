<h1>SPEC_SET - Special Set</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little boy Sai is fascinated with Natural Numbers. He especially likes Special Sets of order **k**. A set of numbers **S**, is called Special Set of order k if, for any two numbers **x** and **y** **(not necessarily distinct)** belonging to **S**, **x should not be equal to k\*y**.
Now, Sai wants to find the size of maximum possible Special Set formed out of the numbers **1,2,3...n.** Hope you can help him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains **t(1<=t<=10 $ ^{5} $ )**, the number of test cases. Next **t** lines contain two space separated integers **n** and **k**.
**1<=n,k<=10 $ ^{8} $**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output on a single line the size of maximal Special set.</div>
