<h1>MBEEWALK - Bee Walk</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MBEEWALK/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MBEEWALK/vn/) ```
A bee larva living in a hexagonal cell of a large honey comb decides to creep
for a walk. In each “step” the larva may move into any of the six adjacent cells
and after n steps, it is to end up in its original cell.
Your program has to compute, for a given n, the number of different such larva walks.
```
