<h1>VECTAR5 - Count Subsets</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入n，给定一个字符串$s$={1,2,3,4,5,6,……n}
求有多少个$s$的子集$a$和$b$，$a$不是$b$的子集，$b$也不是$a$的子集
多组输入，第一行输入$t$,后面$t$行每行输入每组数据的$n$d答案$mod 10^{9}+7$ </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a set S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. Your task is simple. You have to calculate the number of ways of selecting non empty subsets A and B such that A is not a subset of B and B is not a subset of A. Since answer can be large output the result mod 10^9 + 7.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains single integer t denoting number of test cases.
Next t lines contain a single integer n.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output answer to problem by taking mod with 10^9 + 7.</div>
