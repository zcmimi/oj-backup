<div>## 题目描述
有一天杰瑞得到了一个GPS，所以在那之后他可以准确地发现汤姆的位置。
房子有N（1 <= N <= 1000）个房间，编号从1到n和E（1 <= E <= 1000）走廊，每个走廊连接两个不同的房间，两个房间之间最多有一个走廊。当Jerry获得GPS时，他在房间No.P（1 <= P <= N），而Tom在房间No.Q（1 <= Q <= N）。您可以假设房间号P和房间号Q在一个连接的组件中，并且它们不是同一个房间。如果他们在同一个房间，杰瑞可以尽快愚弄汤姆。现在杰瑞想尽快到达汤姆的房间。在每个时间单位，他都会检测到汤姆的位置，并选择离他最近的房间旁边的房间的位置，然后去那个房间。如果有几个房间满足上述条件，他将选择房间号最小的房间。在那之后，如果他们在同一个房间，杰瑞会留下来玩汤姆，或者他会再一次重复这个过程。
每个时间单位，他将选择他所在房间旁边的房间去那个房间，或者以相同的概率留在他现在的房间里。
例如，如果Tom现在在房间1，房间2和房间3是房间1的唯一邻居（即房间1和房间2之间有走廊，房间1和房间3之间有走廊），在下一个时间单位，汤姆在1,2或3房间的概率都是1/3。
假设在每个时间单位，杰瑞先移动，汤姆将在杰瑞完成他的行动后移动。你的任务是计算从Jerry获得GPS到Jerry和Tom在同一个房间的时间的预期时间单位。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You may know the great American cartoon called _Tom and Jerry_. In that cartoon, Tom is a stupid cat, and Jerry is a cute mouse. They are all living in Blue Mary's house. (Maybe the name of the owner of the house they living in is not Blue Mary, but this is not important. ^\_^)
One day Jerry gets a GPS, so after that he can detect Tom's position accurately. He decides to play tricks on Tom again. The house has N (1<= N <= 1000) rooms numbered from 1 to n and E(1<= E <=1000) corridors, each connects two different rooms, and there is at most one corridor between two rooms. When Jerry gets the GPS, he is in room No.P(1<= P <=N) while Tom is in room No.Q(1<= Q <= N). You may assume that room No.P and room No.Q is in one connected componenet and they are not the same room. Since Jerry is very cute and Tom is very stupid, if they are in the same room, Jerry can befool Tom as soon as possible. Now Jerry wants to get to Tom's room as soon as possible. At each time unit, he will detect Tom's position, and choose the room next to his room which is the nearest to Tom's position and go to that room. If there are several rooms satisfied the condition above, he will choose the one with the least room number. After that, if they are in the same room, Jerry will stay and play tricks on Tom, or he will repeat this progress one more time otherwise.
Now poor Tom doesn't know he'll be played, he is taking a walk in the house leisurely. Each time unit he will choose a room next to the room he is in and go to that room or stay in the room he is in now, with equal probability. For example, if Tom is now in room 1, room 2 and room 3 are the only neighbors of room 1 (i.e. there is a corridor between room 1 and room 2, and there is a corridor between room 1 and room 3), at the next time unit, the probability of that Tom is in room 1,2 or 3 are all 1/3.
Suppose at each time unit, Jerry moves first, and Tom will move after Jerry complete his move. You task is to calculate the expected time unit from the time when Jerry gets the GPS to the time when Jerry and Tom are in the same room.</div>
