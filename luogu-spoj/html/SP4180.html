<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
我们的朋友Picko非常富有，他想开设一些餐厅。主要的食物是披萨。 他能在一些特定地点开餐厅，他知道很多他的顾客的住所。 每个餐厅的送餐范围将包含给定半径内的所有顾客住所。 Picko只能开设数量有限的餐馆，他希望餐厅的送餐范围能包含最大数量的顾客。
请你编写一个程序，计算可以接到餐厅送货的顾客的最大数量。
输入
第一行输入包含两个整数K和R，用空格分隔，分别表示Picko最多能开的餐馆数量和每个餐馆的送餐半径，1≤K≤10,1≤R≤500。
第二行输入包含整数M，表示Picko能在M个位置开餐馆，K≤M≤20。在接下来的M行中，有两个整数X和Y，用空格分隔，表示每个能开餐馆的位置的坐标，-1000≤X，Y≤1000。
在下一行中有一个奇数N，1≤N≤100。在接下来的N行中，有三个整数X，Y和S，用空格分隔，X和Y是每个顾客住所的坐标，S是住所内的顾客数， -1000≤X，Y≤1000,1≤S≤100。如果顾客住所与餐馆之间的距离小于或等于R，我们认为顾客住所在某餐馆的半径范围内。
在同一个地方不会有两个餐馆。
输出
唯一一行输出应包含餐馆送餐半径所能包含的最大顾客数量

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/PIZZALOC/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/PIZZALOC/vn/)Our friend Picko is very reach and he wants to open lots of restaurants with delivery. The main food will be, of course, pizza. He has certain number of potential locations for the restaurants, and he knows the locations of the solitairs with lots of people which will often be his customers. Delivery of each restaurant will cover all the solitairs in given radius.
Picko can open only limited number of restaurants, and he wants that restaurants on the locations which will cover maximal number of people in solitairs.
Write a program that will calculate maximal number of people which we can cover with delivery.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of the input file there are two integers K and R, separated with space, number of restaurants and radius of delivery, 1
In the second line there is integer M, number of locations, K
In each of the next M lines there are two integer X and Y, separated with space, coordinates of each location, -1000
In the next line there is integerN, number of solitairs, 1
In each of the next N lines there are three integers X, Y and S, separated with space, X and Y are coordinates of each solitaire, and S is number of people in that solitaire, -1000
We consider that solitaire is in radius of some restaurant if distance between them is less or equal to R. There are no two locations of restaurants on the same place.</div>
