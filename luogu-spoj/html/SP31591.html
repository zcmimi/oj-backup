<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>_Before you begin, you should try this problem! [AVL Tree](../SDITSAVL/)_
This problem is simple. Initially, there is a list and it's empty. Then you are given four types of query.
1. Insert data to the list
2. Remove data from the list
3. Print an index (1-based) from a specified data after the list was sorted ascendingly
4. Print data from a specified index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input contains several lines. Each line follows one of these formats.
**1 n**: Insert **n** (0 <= n <= 2 $ ^{31} $ - 1) to the list
**2 n**: Remove **n** from the list. If **n** was not found, do nothing
**3 n**: Print **n**'s index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly
**4 i**: Print data on **i**-th index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly (0 <= i <= 2 $ ^{31} $ - 1)
**-1**: End of input</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query 3, print **n**'s index in one line. If **n** was not found, just print -1
For each query 4, print data on **i-**th index in one line. If the index is not valid, just print -1</div>
