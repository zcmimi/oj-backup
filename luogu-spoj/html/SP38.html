<h1>LABYR1 - Labyrinth</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题干部分：
金字塔的北部有一个巨大的、非常混乱的迷宫。这个迷宫被分成了很多正方形的小块，每一个小块只有两种状态：被石头堵住了或者什么也没有。在每一个空的小方格的正中央都有一个铁钩子。ACM团队发现两个钩子必须要被一根连接了它经过的所有格子上的钩子的绳子相连。当这根绳子收紧的时候，一扇秘密的门就会被打开。但问题在于，我们并不清楚应该连接哪些钩子。因此，绳子所需的长度我们也不清楚。你的任务就是：计算出我们所必须的绳子长度的最大值。 输入格式：
第一行有一个整数T，表示有T组输入数据。每一组数据的第一行有两个整数C和R (3 <= C,R <= 1000)，表示迷宫的行数和列数。接下来有R行，每一行有C个字符，代表整个迷宫。字符只有可能是“#”或者“.”，“#”代表这个格子被堵住了，“.”代表没有石头。我们可以且只能在两个相邻（即有一条公共边）的格子之间走动，而不能跑到迷宫外面或者斜着走。 迷宫经过特殊的设计，因此它满足任意两个没有被堵住的方格之间有且只有一条路可以互相到达。所以，当我们知道应该连接哪些钩子的时候，我们就能很容易地把它们连起来。 输出格式： 对于每一组输入数据，要求输出一行答案，格式为“Maximum rope length is X.”，其中X即为你求出的答案：两个距离最远的格子之间的距离长度，以格为单位。 说明： “温馨”提示：输入或者输出数据可能很长，请使用某些语言的朋友们小心一些哦~

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> The northern part of the Pyramid contains a very large and complicated labyrinth. The labyrinth is divided into square blocks, each of them either filled by rock, or free. There is also a little hook on the floor in the center of every free block. The ACM have found that two of the hooks must be connected by a rope that runs through the hooks in every block on the path between the connected ones. When the rope is fastened, a secret door opens. The problem is that we do not know which hooks to connect. That means also that the neccessary length of the rope is unknown. Your task is to determine the maximum length of the rope we could need for a given labyrinth.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T) is given on the first line of the input file. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers C and R (3 <= C,R <= 1000) indicating the number of columns and rows. Then exactly R lines follow, each containing C characters. These characters specify the labyrinth. Each of them is either a hash mark (`#`) or a period (`.`). Hash marks represent rocks, periods are free blocks. It is possible to walk between neighbouring blocks only, where neighbouring blocks are blocks sharing a common side. We cannot walk diagonally and we cannot step out of the labyrinth.
The labyrinth is designed in such a way that there is exactly one path between any two free blocks. Consequently, if we find the proper hooks to connect, it is easy to find the right path connecting them.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your program must print exactly one line of output for each test case. The line must contain the sentence "`Maximum rope length is X.`" where Xis the length of the longest path between any two free blocks, measured in blocks.</div>
