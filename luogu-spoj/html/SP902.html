<h1>HANGOVER - Hangover</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
你能在多大程度上让一堆卡片悬在一张桌子上？如果您有一张卡，则可以让它伸出一半。（假设卡片贴近桌子）。使用两张卡片，您可以将顶部卡片从底部悬垂一半，卡片总长度增加一半，而底部卡片占据卡片长度的三分之一。总长度为`1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6`张卡长度。一般来说，你可以通过：
>$1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1 /（n + 1）$
使n张卡在桌面边缘悬垂，如下图所示：
![card](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/SP902/8ccd09d5b4ba38109fdb97ee75300822589000bc.png)
（最后一张卡的两端完全脱离桌面）
## 输入格式
输入包含多组正浮点型数据，以0.00为结束，值在0.01
与5.20之间。（取小数点后两位），表示每种卡片的长度。
## 输出格式
输出实现长度为c的卡片有一张完全脱离桌面所需的最少卡数（格式详见样例数据）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>How far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make _n_ cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(_n_ + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(_n_ + 1). This is illustrated in the figure below.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of one or more test cases, followed by a line containing the number 0.00 that signals the end of the input. Each test case is a single line containing a positive floating-point number _c_ whose value is at least 0.01 and at most 5.20; _c_ will contain exactly three digits.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output the minimum number of cards necessary to achieve an overhang of at least _c_ card lengths. Use the exact output format shown in the examples.
```
Input:
