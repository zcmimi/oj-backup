<h1>INTEGMAX - Integral Maximization</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A set of points on the XY plane, all of them with different x coordinate, defines a polygonal
line in the following way: sort the points in increasing order of their x coordinates, and connect
each point with its neighbors. The integral of such polygonal line is the area contained below
the line and above the x axis, between the first and last values of x. For instance, the set of
points {(5, 1), (3, 2), (6, 2), (2, 1)} defines the polygonal line shown in the figure; the integral of
the polygonal line is the shaded area, with a value of 6.

Given a set of N different values for x, and a set of N values for y, we want to pair them to
form N points on the plane such that the integral of the polygonal line defined by the points is
as large as possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly three lines. The first line of
each test case contains an integer N indicating the number of points in the set (2 The second line contains N different integers Xi separated by single spaces (1 for 1 (Xi < Xi+1 for 1 (1 particular order. The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should not be processed
as a test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a single line with the maximum integral of a polygonal line formed
by pairing the input values, using exactly one decimal digit. Notice that one decimal digit is
always enough to represent the exact value of the integral of a polygonal line defined by points
with integer coordinates.</div>
