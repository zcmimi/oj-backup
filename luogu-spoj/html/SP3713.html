<h1>PROOT - Primitive Root</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
给你一个质数$p$以及$n$组询问， 判定给定的$r$是否为$p$的原根。
### 输入输出格式
#### 输入格式
题目有多组测试数据。
每组测试数据的第一行两个正整数$p,n(p<2^{31},1\le n\le 100)$。
以下$n$行， 每行一个数表示这组询问中的$r$。
当$n=p=0$的时候表示输入数据结束， 无需回答。保证数据组数最多60组。
#### 输出格式
对于每组询问， 若$r$是$p$的原根， 输出`YES`， 否则输出`NO`。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the field of Cryptography, prime numbers play an important role. We are interested in a scheme called "Diffie-Hellman" key exchange which allows two communicating parties to exchange a secret key. This method requires a prime number **p** and **r** which is a primitive root of p to be publicly known. For a prime number p, r is a primitive root if and only if it's exponents r, r $ ^{2} $ , r $ ^{3} $ , ... , r $ ^{p-1} $ are distinct (mod p).
Cryptography Experts Group (CEG) is trying to develop such a system. They want to have a list of prime numbers and their primitive roots. You are going to write a program to help them. Given a prime number p and another integer r < p , you need to tell whether r is a primitive root of p.
### Input
There will be multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers **p** ( p < 2 $ ^{31} $ ) and **n** (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 ) separated by a space on a single line. p is the prime number we want to use and n is the number of candidates we need to check. Then n lines follow each containing a single integer to check. An empty line follows each test case and the end of test cases is indicated by p=0 and n=0 and it should not be processed. The number of test cases is atmost 60.
### Output
For each test case print "YES" (quotes for clarity) if r is a primitive root of p and "NO" (again quotes for clarity) otherwise.
### Example
```
Input:
5 2
3
4
7 2
3
4
0 0
Output:
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
### Explanation
In the first test case 3 $ ^{1} $ , 3 $ ^{2} $ , 3 $ ^{3} $ and 3 $ ^{4} $ are respectively 3, 4, 2 and 1 (mod 5). So, 3 is a primitive root of 5.
4 $ ^{1} $ , 4 $ ^{2} $ , 4 $ ^{3} $ and 4 $ ^{4} $ are respectively 4, 1, 4 and 1 respectively. So, 4 is not a primitive root of 5.</div>
