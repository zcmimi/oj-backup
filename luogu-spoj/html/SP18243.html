<h1>IITWPC4A - Maggu and Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Maggu and Coder were playing a game with strings. In each turn of the game, Maggu gives Coder a string. Coder can replace m consecutive 'a' in the string by n consecutive 'b' any number of times. This way he has to create 2 strings, one of maximum possible length and one of minimum possible length.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains a single integer T : number of test cases.(1<=T<=100).
For each test case there are exactly two lines.
First line contains a string s (1 <= length(s) <= 10^5) containing letters only from 'a' to 'z'.
Second line contains two space separated integers representing m and n respectively.(1 <= m,n <= 10^5).
Sum of length(s) over all test cases is <= 10^6.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print in a single line containing two space separated integers representing minimum and maximum length of string s that Coder can obtain.</div>
