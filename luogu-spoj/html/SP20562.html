<h1>TANDC - Tracy and Charlie</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tracy is teaching Charlie maths via a game called N-Cube, which involves three sections involving N.
Tracy gives Charlie a number N, and Charlie makes a list of N $ ^{th} $ powers of integers in increasing order (1 $ ^{N} $ , 2 $ ^{N} $ , 3 $ ^{N} $ .. so on). This teaches him exponentiation.
Then Charlie performs the following subtraction game N times : Take all pairs of consecutive numbers in the list and take their difference. These differences then form the new list for the next iteration of the game. Eg, if N was 6, the list proceeds as \[1, 64, 729, 4096 ... \] to \[63, 685, 3367 ...\], and so on 5 more times.
After the subtraction game, Charlie has to correctly tell Tracy the Nth element of the list. This number is the _value of the game_.
After practice Charlie became an expert in the game. To challenge him more, Tracy will give two numbers **M** (where M is a prime) and **R** instead of just a single number N, and the game must start from **M $ ^{R} $ - 1** instead of N. Since the _value of the game_ can now become large, Charlie just have to tell the largest integer K such that M $ ^{K} $ divides this number. Since even K can be large, output K modulo 1000000007 (10 $ ^{9} $ +7).
**INPUT:**
First line will contain **T**, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow
Each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers **M R**
**OUTPUT:**
For each testcase, output in a single line answer given by Charlie to Tracy modulo 1000000007.
**CONSTRAINTS:**
1<=T<=1000
2<=M<=10 $ ^{9} $
1<=R<=10 $ ^{9} $
M is a prime number
**SAMPLE INPUT:**
1
2 2
**SAMPLE OUTPUT:**
1
**EXPLANATION:**
This list is : \[1,8,27,64,125..\] -> \[7,19,37,61..\] -> \[12,18,24..\] -> \[6,6,6..\]. Number of times 2 divides 6 is 1. Hence the answer is 1.</div>
