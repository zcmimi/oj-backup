<h1>RIOI_2_3 - Path of the righteous man</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given N\*N matrix A filled with integers, which represents map of country "What" ("What" ain't no country I ever heard of) . Our hero is called Brett. Brett has many enemies, namely Jules and Vincent (Jules doesn't like him because he said "what" too many times), but his biggest enemy is Marcellus Wallace, because Brett treated him like a male dog treats female dog. And Marcellus most certainly does not look like a female dog.
But Brett cannot sit at home all day enjoying his Big Kahuna burgers, he has to go from cell (sx, sy) to cell (ex, ey).
From cell (x, y) Bret can go to (x+1, y), (x, y+1), (x-1, y), (x, y-1).
If A\[x\]\[y\] = S, we say that this cell is property of mafia boss S. When Brett visits cell (x, y), and has not yet apologised to boss A\[x\]\[y\], then he apologizes, after that he can visit any cell controlled by A\[x\]\[y\] without apologizing. Brett does not like to apologise ( because there is always chance to hear Ezekiel 25 17 ), so he asks you to find him path which minimizes number of times he has to apologise.
