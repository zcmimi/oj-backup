<h1>MUL2COM - Binary multiplication</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MUL2COM/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MUL2COM/vn/)In this problem, you have to multiply two n-bit binary numbers in 2s complement form. The result should be also a n-bit binary number in 2s complement form. In case there is an arithmetic overflow, you program should be able to detect it.
For your information, the 2s complement form of -x is the number 2^n-x. A n-bit 2s complement number ranges from -2 $ ^{n-1} $ to 2 $ ^{n-1} $ -1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are multiple test cases (no more than 40). For each test case, there are three input lines. The first line contains n (0 ≤ n ≤ 1024). n=0 signals the end of the input. Otherwise, the second and third lines contain the two n-bit binary numbers.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output "overflow" if there is an arithmetic overflow. Otherwise, print the result in 2s complement form.</div>
