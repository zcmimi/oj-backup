<h1>MINES4 - Four Mines</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A Company that Makes Everything (ACME) has entered the surface mining business. They bought a rectangular field which is split into cells, with each cell having a profit value. A mine is a non-empty rectangular region, and the profit of a mine is equal to the sum of the values of all its cells. ACME wants to extract ore from four different non-overlapping mines. You are to choose these mines to maximize the total profit.
