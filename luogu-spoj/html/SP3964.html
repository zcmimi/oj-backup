<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/MTEMP/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MTEMP/vn/)John never knew he had a grand-uncle, until he received the notary’s letter. He learned that his late grand-uncle had gathered a lot of money, somewhere in South-America, and that John was the only inheritor.
John did not need that much money for the moment. But he realized that it would be a good idea to store this capital in a safe place, and have it grow until he decided to retire. The bank convinced him that a certain kind of bond was interesting for him. This kind of bond has a ﬁxed value, and gives a ﬁxed amount of yearly interest, payed to the owner at the end of each year.
```
```
The bond has no ﬁxed term. Bonds are available in different sizes. The larger ones usually give a better interest. Soon John realized that the optimal set of bonds to buy was not trivial to ﬁgure out. Moreover, after a few years his capital would have grown, and the schedule had to be re-evaluated. Assume the following bonds are available:
```
Value Annual interest
4000 400
3000 250
```
With a capital of 10 000$ one could buy two bonds of 4000$, giving a yearly interest of 800$. Buying two bonds of 3000$, and one of 4000$ is a better idea, as it gives a yearly interest of e900. After two years the capital has grown to 11800$, and it makes sense to sell a 3000$ one and buy a 4000$ one, so the annual interest grows to 1050$.
This iswhere this story grows unlikely: the bank does not charge for buying and selling bonds. Next year the total sum is 12850$, which allows for three times 4000$, giving a yearly interest of 1200$. Here is your problem: given an amount to begin with, a number of years, and a set of bonds with their values and interests, ﬁnd out how big the amount may grow in the given period, using the best schedule for buying and selling bonds.
```
Input
```
```
The ﬁrst line contains a single positive integer N which is the number
of test cases.
The ﬁrst line of a test case contains two positive integers:
the amount to start with (at most 1000 000$), and the number of years the
capital may grow (at most 40).
The following line contains a single number: the number d (1
