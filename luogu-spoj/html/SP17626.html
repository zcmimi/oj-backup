<h1>CUTCAKE - Eat all the brownies !</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>布朗尼兄弟在派对上为客人切蛋糕。但布朗尼兄弟既懒惰又饥肠辘辘，所以他们想把蛋糕切成最大数量的碎片，并切割最少的次数，然后去吃布朗尼蛋糕。
派对的主持人说，布朗尼兄弟可以将蛋糕切成不等的块，但不能切割出多个平面（只允许垂直切割）。请根据客人数量，找到足以提供蛋糕块的切割数量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>BrownieDude was given the job of cutting cake at a party for serving the guests. But BrownieDude is both lazy and hungry, so he wants to cut the cake into maximum number of pieces with minimum number of cuts and go off to eating brownies.
The host of the party says that BrownieDude can cut the cake into unequal pieces but cannot cut in more than one plane.(Only vertical cuts are allowed.) Given the number of guests, find the number of cuts sufficient to generate the cake pieces.</div>

<br />
<div>First line contains 't', the number of test cases. 't' lines follow. (1 <= t <= 1000)
Each line denotes the number of guests. (1 <= n <= 10^11)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
