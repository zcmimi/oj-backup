<h1>POTHOLE - Potholers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A team of speleologists organizes a training in the Great Cave of Byte Mountains. During the training each speleologist explores a route from Top Chamber to Bottom Chamber. The speleologists may move down only, i.e. the level of every consecutive chamber on a route should be lower then the previous one. Moreover, each speleologist has to start from Top Chamber through a different corridor and each of them must enter Bottom Chamber using different corridor. The remaining corridors may be traversed by more than one speleologist. How many speleologists can train simultaneously?
### Task
Write a program which:
- reads the cave description from the standard input,
- computes the maximal number of speleologists that may train simultaneously,
- writes the result to the standard output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line. In the first line of each test case there is one integer _n_ (_2<=n<=200_), equal to the number of chambers in the cave. The chambers are numbered with integers from _1_ to _n_ in descending level order - the chamber of grater number is at the higher level than the chamber of the lower one. (Top Chamber has number _1,_ and Bottom Chamber has number _n_). In the following _n-1_lines (i.e. lines _2,3,...,n_) the descriptions of corridors are given. The (_i+1_)-th line contains numbers of chambers connected by corridors with the _i_-th chamber. (only chambers with numbers grater then _i_ are mentioned). The first number in a line, _m_, _0<=m<=_(_n-i+1_), is a number of corridors exiting the chamber being described. Then the following _m_ integers are the numbers of the chambers the corridors are leading to.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Your program should write one integer for each test case. This number should be equal to the maximal number of speleologists able to train simultaneously,</div>
