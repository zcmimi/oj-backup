<h1>ADAGRAFT - Ada and Graft</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows a big fruit [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) (with root in 0). There is a fruit on every node of the tree. Ada is competing in grafting competition and this is her masterpiece. The most valuable tree wins the competition. The value of tree is product of values of each node. The value of a node is the number of distinct fruit kinds in its subtree.
Can you find the value of Ada's tree? Since this number might be pretty big, output it modulo **10 $ ^{9} $ +7**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and line will contain **1 .**
The next line will contain **N-1** integers **0 , the parent of i $ ^{th} $ node.**
The next line will contain **N** integers **0 , the fruit growing on i $ ^{th} $ node.**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer - the value of tree modulo **1000000007**.</div>
