<h1>ALTSEQ - Alternating Sequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given an array a of N integers a1, a2, a3, ... aN you have to find the longest alternating sub-sequence of this array .
An alternating sequence b1, b2 ... bk, k>=1 is a sequence that has the 2 following properties:
1.|b1|<|b2|<|b3|<.....<|bk|
2. The signs alternate between adjacent elements, i.e, if b1 > 0 then b20 and so on. Alternatively, if b10, b3 A sub sequence of array a is a sequence obtained by dropping some elements of the array a. Here is the formal definition.
It is guaranteed that the array a contains no element equal to 0.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the size of the array. The next line contains N integers , denoting the array a.</div>
