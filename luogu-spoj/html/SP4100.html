<h1>MVECTOR - Sum of Vectors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/MVECTOR/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MVECTOR/vn/)We can represent a 2D vector as a pair (X,Y). The sum of two or more vectors is a vector whose coordinates are the sums of the corresponding coordinates of all the vectors in the sum. e.g. (1,2)+(3,4)+(5,6) = (1+3+5,2+4+6) = (9,12) Weight of a vector (x,y) is defined as x\*x+y\*y. You are given N vectors on a plain.
Your task is to write a program that will determine a subset of those vectors so the weight of the sum of all vectors in that subset is maximal.
Note: Use 64-bit integers (int64 in pascal or long long in c)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of the input file is an integer N, 1
The following N lines contain descriptions for each of the vectors. A description is made of two integers X and Y, separated by a single blank, -30,000
None of the given vectors will be (0,0)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first and only line of the output file you have to write the weight of the maximum sum.</div>
