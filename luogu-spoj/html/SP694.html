<h1>DISUBSTR - Distinct Substrings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定一个字符串，求该字符串含有的本质不同的子串数量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a string, we need to find the total number of its distinct substrings.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>T- number of test cases. T<=20;
Each test case consists of one string, whose length is <= 1000</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output one number saying the number of distinct substrings.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>\n
  2\n
  CCCCC\n
  ABABA</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>\n
  5\n
  9


Explanation for the testcase with string ABABA: \n
  len=1 : A,B\n
  len=2 : AB,BA\n
  len=3 : ABA,BAB\n
  len=4 : ABAB,BABA\n
  len=5 : ABABA\n

  Thus, total number of distinct substrings is 9.\n</code></pre>
