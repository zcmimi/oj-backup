<h1>ROOT - Root of a Linear Equation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two nonnegative integers _a_ and _b_, you are to generate the solution of the equation **b\*x=a**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The number of test cases is given in the very first line. For each test case there is a single line containing two integers _a_ and _b_ without any leading zeroes, separated by a single space.
_Tip_: For more than 95% of test cases, **int** in C/C++/Java or **longint** in Pascal is enough.
The input file is about 1.4 KB.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single line containing the root in decimal cyclic notations, or "Invalid Input!!!"(without quotes) if the solution is not unique or the solution doesn't exist. See the example for more details.
The output file is about 1.3MB.</div>
