<h1>SPCM - Gopu and function</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Once Gopu was reading a maths problem which had a weird looking function f as follows.
{
1, if n is a prime number.
**f(n) =** f (sum of prime divisors of n) + number of distinct prime divisors of n, otherwise.
}
Compute f (n) for a given value of n.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T : number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 20)
For each test case, there is a single line containing integer n. (2 <= n <= 10^12).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output value of f (n) in a single line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>6\n2\n3\n4\n5\n20\n123456&amp;nbsp;</code></pre>
