<h1>FRNDZND - Friend Zoned</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Pavel proposed a girl. Of course, she didn’t say yes, rather she gave him an array having N integers and asked him M queries over the array. Each query can be represented as two integers L & R.
For each query, Pavel should do the following:
1. First, he has to insert the numbers at index L, L+1, L+2,……,R of the given array into a multi-set. Multi-set is a set where an element can appear multiple times. Suppose that the size of this multi-set after inserting the numbers is k. Formally, k is equal to R-L+1.
2. Then he has to generate all possible subset of the multi-set which he constructed in step 1. Then for each subset he needs to xor the numbers of that subset. In this way, he will get 2^k values. Note that, for the empty set he will get 0.
3. Finally, he has to xor the 2^k values which he got at step 2 and say this value to his dream girl.
If Pavel can answer all the queries correctly then she will reconsider his proposal. Can you help him to answer the queries?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
