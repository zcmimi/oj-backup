<h1>LINELAND - Lineland Airport</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Lineland is a strange country. As the name suggests, it's shape (as seen from above) is just a straight line, rather than some two-dimensional shape. The landscape along this line is very mountainous, something which occasionally leads to some problems. One such problem now occurs: in this modern era the king wants to build an airport to stimulate the country's economy. Unfortunately, it's impossible for airplanes to land on steep airstrips, so a horizontal piece of land is needed. To accommodate for the larger airplanes, this strip needs to have length at least _L_.
Over the years, the inhabitants of Lineland have become very proficient in flattening pieces of land. Given a piece a land, they can remove rock quickly. They don't want to add rock for that may lead to an unstable landing strip. To minimize the amount of effort, however, they want to remove the least amount of rock necessary to reach their goal: a flat piece of land of length _L_. What is this minimum amount? Because of the low-dimensional nature of Lineland, the amount of rock that needs to be removed is measured as the total area of land above the place where the landing strip is placed, rather than the volume (so in the Figure below, the amount of land removed is given by the lightly shaded area).

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> One line with a positive number: the number of test cases (at most 25). Then for each test case:
- One line with an integer _N_, 2 ≤ _N_ ≤ 500, the number of points, and an integer _L_, 1 ≤ _L_ ≤ 10000, the necessary length to flatten.
- _N_ lines with two integers _x $ _{i} $_ and _y $ _{i} $_ with 0 ≤ _x $ _{i} $_ , _y $ _{i} $_ ≤ 10000 describing the landscape of Lineland. The _x $ _{i} $_ are in (strictly) ascending order. At position _x $ _{i} $_ the height of the landscape is _x $ _{i} $_ . Between two _x $ _{i} $_ the landscape has constant slope. (So the landscape is piecewise linear). The difference between _x $ _{N} $_ and _x $ _{1} $_ is greater than or equal to _L_.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case, output one line with the minimum amount of rock which must be removed in order to build the airport. The answer should be given as a floating point number with an absolute error of at most 10 $ ^{-3} $ .</div>
