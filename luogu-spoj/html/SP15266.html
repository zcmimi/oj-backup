<h1>THRPWRS - III Powers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider the set of all non-negative integer powers of 3.
_S_ = { 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... }
Consider the sequence of all subsets of _S_ ordered by the value of the sum of their elements. The question is simple: find the set at the _n_-th position in the sequence and print it in increasing order of its elements.
Each line of input contains a number _n_, which is a positive integer with no more than 19 digits. The last line of input contains 0 and it should not be processed.
For each line of input, output a single line displaying the _n_-th set as described above, in the format used in the sample output.
### Input
```
1
7
14
783
1125900981634049
0
```
### Output
```
