<h1>IITKWPCC - Count right angle triangles</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given n points in a 2D plane. You are asked these an inherently simple questions about them.
You have to find out number of right angle triangles (having base and height parrallel to axis) with the property that length of base and height is same.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First Line will n: number of points. (n <= 10^5).
For next n lines each line will contain two integers x and y. (-10^8 <= x, y <= 10^8).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You have to output a single line containing the answer to question.</div>
