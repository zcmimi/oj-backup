<h1>MANJFIRE - Manoj and Fire</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Manoj is a geek who loves ciphering data. He is also known for doing stupid things like setting fire in his room like a caveman. One day he does that and accidentally throws a paper containing some sensitive information. However, he has the encrypted version of the data.
Each number in the original text is the number of pairs of integers **A**,**B (A<B, 1 <=A,B <=N)** such that their GCD Quotients match the given set of integers. GCD Quotients of a pair **(A,B)** is defined as the sequence of quotients that are obtained while computing the gcd of **A** and **B** **using Euclid's Algorithm**. For example,

 `<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 90px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;">          GCD(7,9) = </div>`</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>The first line contains **T**, the number of test cases. Each test case contains two integers **N** and **Q** on the first line and **Q** integers on the second line, denoting the quotient sequence.</div>
    <h3>输出格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>For each test case, output the number of pairs of integers, whose gcd quotient sequence match with the given sequence.</div>
