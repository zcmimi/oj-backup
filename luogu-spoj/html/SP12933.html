<h1>NDIV - n-divisors</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>大致翻译：求[a,b]中约数个数为n的数的个数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> We all know about prime numbers, prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
We can Classify the numbers by its number of divisors, as n-divisors-numbers, for example number 1 is 1-divisor number, number 4 is 3-divisors-number... etc.
**Note**: All prime numbers are 2-divisors numbers.
**Example:**
8 is a 4-divisors-number \[1, 2, 4, 8\].</div>
