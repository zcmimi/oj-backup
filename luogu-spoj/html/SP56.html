<h1>DYZIO - Dyzio</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>描述
Dyzio的朋友是Jasiek，他也喜欢谜语。他想出了一个谜语：
Jasiek，这有一根绳子，必须切成小段。我不告诉你怎么做，看这个0（0）和1（1）的序列。前面的意思是必须把绳子切成两半。如果第一个数字是零，那么它将是序列中唯一的数字，意味着你不必剪切绳子，需要整个字符串。如果你无论如何都要剪断绳子，那么在第一个1之后，我写了如何处理左边的部分（根据与整个字符串相同的规则），然后我写了如何处理右边的部分（始终使用相同的符号规则）。每次你必须先切左边的部分，只有这样你才能切右边的部分。现在开始切割，告诉我，在切割出最短的部分之前，你需要做多少切割。
不幸的是，妈妈把剪刀藏起来不让Jasiek看到，但幸运的是，有一台电脑，他很快写了一个程序来模拟切线。你能写这样的程序吗？
任务
编写一个程序
读取（标准输入）字符串切割方式的描述，
计算为了得到第一个最短的部分必须进行多少次切割。
写出结果（标准输出）
输入输出格式
输入：
十个测试点（一个接一个处理！）.每个测试点由两行组成。在第一行中有一个数字n（1<=n<=20000）。在第二行，长度为n字（没有空格）——对Dyzio给出的切割程序的描述。
输出：
对于每个测试点，您的程序应写（标准输出）一行，其中一个整数等于为了得到最短的片段而必须进行的切割数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Dyzio is Jasiek's friend and he also likes riddles. Here is a riddle he came up with:
_Jasiek, here is a piece of string, which has to be cut into smaller pieces. I will not tell you directly how to do it, but look at this sequence of zeros (0) and ones (1). A one at the begining means that the string has to be cut in half. If the first digit was zero, it would be the only digit in the sequence and mean you don't have to cut anything - I want the whole string. If you have to cut the string anyway then after the first 1 I wrote what to do with the left piece (according to the same rules as with the whole string) and then I wrote what to do with the right piece of string (all the time with the same rules of notation). Every time you have to cut the left piece first, only then can you cut the right one. Now start cutting and tell me, how many cuts you have to do until you have cut off the shortest piece._
Unfortunately mom hid the scissors from Jasiek, but luckily a computer was at hand and Jasiek quickly wrote a program simulating the string cutting. Can you write such a program?
Task
-----
Write a program which
- reads (from standard input) description of the way the string is cut,
- counts how many cuts have to be made in order to get the first shortest piece.
- writes out the outcome (to standard output)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each test case consists of two lines. In the first line there is a number _n (1<=n<=20000)_. In the second line one zero-one word (a sequence of zeros and ones without spaces between them) of length _n_ - the description of the cutting procedure given by Dyzio.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every testcase your program should write (to the standard output) only one line with one integer equal to the number of cuts which have to be made in order to get the shortest piece.</div>
