<h1>SUMITR - Sums in a Triangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Let us consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:
- on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right;
- the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100;
- all numbers are positive integers between O and 99.
Take care about your fingers, do not use more than **256** bytes of code.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case write the determined value in a separate line.</div>
