<h1>CVXPOLY - Convex Polygons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/CVXPOLY/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/CVXPOLY/vn/)You are given n points in the 2-D cartesian coordinate system. You are to determine the number of convex polygons with 3 or more vertices which can be formed by choosing a subset of the given points. To make matters simple, the input obeys the following conditions:
(1) No 3 points in the input are collinear.
(2) No 2 points will have the same coordinates.
Since the result can be quite large, you are required to output ( result % 1234567 ) instead.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains n, the number of points in the corresponding test case, next n lines contain 2 space separated integers denoting the coordinate of ith point. Absolute value of the coordinates do not exceed 10000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>T lines each corresponding to the answer of corresponding test case.</div>
