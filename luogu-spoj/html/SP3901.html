<h1>BNWNIM - Black and White Nim</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/BNWNIM/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/BNWNIM/vn/)Black-White-Nim is played as follows. There are one or more horizontal rows, each containing several black and white beads. Two players take turns removing beads until there are none left. During each turn, a player must remove one or more consecutive beads from the left end of a single row. The removed beads must contain either no black beads or exactly one black bead. If one black bead is removed, that bead must be the rightmost of the removed beads. The player who takes the last turn wins.
Given the number of black and white beads in each rows. The order of beads in each row is randomly generated at the beginning of the game. Each distinct row ordering is equally likely. Black beads are indistinguishable from one another, and white beads are indistinguishable from one another. Output the probability that the first player will win the game assuming that both players follow an optimal strategy.</div>
