<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**RK** has received a homework assignment to compute the **greatest common divisor** of the two positive integers **A** and **B**. Since the numbers are quite large, the professor provided him with **N** smaller integers whose product is **A**, and **M** integers with product **B**.
RK would like to verify his result, so he has asked you to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more than 9 digits long, output only the **last 9** digits.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the positive integer **N** (1 <= **N** <= 1000).
The second line of input contains **N** space-separated positive integers less than 10^9, whose product is the number **A**.
The third line of input contains the positive integer **M** (1 <= **M** <= 1000).
The fourth line of input contains **M** space-separated positive integers less than 10^9, whose product is the number **B**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of output must contain the greatest common divisor of numbers **A** and **B**. If the result is more than 9 digits long, output only the last (least significant) 9 digits.</div>
