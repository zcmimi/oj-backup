<h1>MINTRIAN - Minimal Triangulations of Graphs</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Check whether the given graph is [chordal](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChordalGraph.html).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer 1<=t<=200 denoting the number of test cases. Then t graphs are given (not necessarily connected). Each graph is described by two lines. The first line contains a string of the form: n=nodes,m=edges: The second line gives the edges of the graph separated by commas. Each edge is given as a pair of vertices: {u,v}. Vertices of the graph are denoted with integers 0...,n-1.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print YES if the graph is chordal, or NO if it isn't.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
