<h1>YASSP - Yet Another Subset Sum Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let **Y** be an array of integers of size **N**.
Let **G(x)** be a set comprising of the size of all the subsets of the array Y whose sum is **x**.
Let **F(G(x))** denote the number of unique elements in the set **G(x)**.
Your task is to find the _maximum value of F(G(x))_ and the _corresponding value x_ for the given array Y.
In Case, many 'x' correspond to maximum F(G(x)), _print the smallest one_.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line describes the number of test cases T.
The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly two lines.
The first line contains an integer N indicating the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains N integers separated by single spaces, representing the elements of the array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For every test case, print two integers: maximum F(G(x)) and the minimum value of x corresponding to it.
**Constraints**
T<=50
1<=N<=50
1<=Y\[i\]<=1000</div>
