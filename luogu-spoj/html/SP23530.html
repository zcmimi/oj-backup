<h1>SUFFIX - Suffixes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Find the smallest natural number X such that, if we write X in bases B $ _{1} $ , B $ _{2} $ , ..., B $ _{N} $ , we get strings with suffixes S $ _{1} $ , S $ _{2} $ , ..., S $ _{N} $ , respectively.
The possible digits are 0123456789ABCDEFG...XYZ, with values 0..35. Of course, the number written in base B consists only of the digits with values between 0 and B - 1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of input there is an integer N (1
In k $ ^{th} $ of the next N lines there is an integer B $ _{k} $ (2
The given bases will be pairwise distinct. Also, the product of the powers B $ _{k} $ ^ lenght(S $ _{k} $ ) will be less than 10 $ ^{18} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
