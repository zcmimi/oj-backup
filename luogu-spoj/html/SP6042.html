<h1>QCJ2 - Another Box Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are N numbered boxes placed on a table, let Bi denote the ith box in the line. Write a program that finds the total number of ways to place N identical balls such that atmost k balls are present in the boxes B1, .... ,Bk for 1<=k<=N. Since the number can be quite large you are supposed to output the answer modulo 761238923.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input will contain multiple testcases, on each line N (1<=N<=100) will be given. The last line contains 0 which should not be processed.</div>
