<h1>TMB - Thousands ByteMan March</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leo invited all his friends to a giant meeting for peace in byteland. All people came in bus which were all full. Last year, they were only 4 people : A, B, C, D. As Leo likes structured things, he thought to form groups. All the ways to form homogeneous teams were :
```
{{A,B,C,D}} : one team of 4 (one way),
{{A}, {B}, {C}, {D}} : four 'teams' of 1 (one way more),
{{A,B}, {C,D}} or {{A,C}, {B,D}} or {{A,D}, {B,C}} : two teams of 2 (3 ways more).
```
for a total of 5 ways. But this year many people are awaited.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line. In each of the next T lines there are two integers : N, K. N is the quantity of bus that came to the meeting. K is the common capacity of each bus.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case, your task is to calculate the number of ways people can form homogeneous teams. The answer can be a big number and could not fit in a 64bit container.</div>
