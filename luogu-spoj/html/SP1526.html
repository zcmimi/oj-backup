<h1>RSORTING - Ranklist Sorting</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
已知参赛选手的得分，你的任务是按照得分从高到底给出选手的排名。 遗憾的是，保存选手信息的数据结构只支持一种操作，即将一个选手从位置$i$移动到位置$j$，该移动不改变其他选手的相对位置，即如果$i>j$，位置$j$和位置$i-1$之间的选手的位置都比原来加 $1$，相反如果 $i < j$，则位置$i+1$和位置$j$之间的选手的位置都比原来减一。上述移动的操作的代价定义为 $i+j$，这里，位置编号从$1$开始。
请你编程确定一个移动选手的步骤， 将选手按照得分从高到低排序， 并使整个移动过程的总代价最小。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
第一行为一个整数 $n(2<=n<=1000)$，表示选手的人数；接下来的$n$行，每行一个非负整数 $S_i(0<=S_i<=1000000)$ ，表示一个选手的得分。你可以认为每人的得分是不同的。
### 输出格式:
第一行为一个整数，表示移动的次数，接下来的每一行表示一个移动步骤，每个移动步骤用两个整数$i$, $j$表示，表示位置$i$的选手移动到位置$j$,$i$和$j$之间有一个空格隔开。 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given the scores of several players in a competition. Your task is to create a ranklist of the players, sorted in decreasing order by score.
Unfortunately, the data structure used for the list of players supports only one operation, which moves a player from position i to position j without changing the relative order of other players. If i > j, the positions of players at positions between j and i − 1 increase by 1, otherwise if i < j the positions of players at positions between i + 1 and j decrease by 1.
This operation takes i steps to locate the player to be moved, and j steps to locate the position where he or she is moved to, so the overall cost of moving a player from position i to position j is i + j. Here, positions are numbered starting with 1.
Determine a sequence of moves to create the ranklist such that the sum of the costs of the moves is minimized.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of **exactly 10** test cases. The first line of each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), the number of players. Each of the following n lines contains one non-negative integer s $ _{i} $ (0 ≤ s $ _{i} $ ≤ 1000000), the scores of the players in the current order. You may assume that all scores are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print in one line the number of moves used to create the ranklist. The following lines should specify the moves in the order in which they are applied. Each move should be described by a line containing two integers i and j, which means that the player at position i is moved to position j. The numbers i and j must be separated by a single space.</div>
