<h1>MAXMATCH - Maximum Self-Matching</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You're given a string **s** consisting of letters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.
The matching function m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) is defined as the number of matching characters of **s** and its i-shift. In other words, m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) is the number of characters that are matched when you align the 0-th character of **s** with the i-th character of its copy.
You are asked to compute the maximum of m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) for all i ( 1 <= i <= |**s**| ). To make it a bit harder, you should also output all the optimal i's in increasing order.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of input contains the string **s**. 2 <= |**s**| <= 10 $ ^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of output contains the maximal m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) over all i.
The second line of output contains all the i's for which m $ _{s} $ ( i ) reaches maximum.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>caccacaa</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>4\n3\n\nExplanation:\n\ncaccacaa\n   caccacaa\n\n\n The bold characters indicate the ones that match when shift = 3.\n\n</code></pre>
