<h1>FROGS - Frog Wrestling</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Billy Jean loves collecting frogs. Recently, she developed the sport of frog wrestling. Now she wants to rank her frogs by their wrestling prowess.
Billy Jean has made a algorithm for sorting her frogs.
1. She arranges N cages, numbered 1,2,...N, each with one frog.
2. For each pair of cages in a specified, pre-determined list of K pairs of cages,
1. she removes the frogs from the two cages,
2. has the frogs wrestle,
3. puts the winner in the higher-numbered cage, and
4. puts the loser in the lower-numbered cage.
When she is finished, she hopes to have all her frogs sorted from worst to best in the cages 1 to N. Will her algorithm work regardless of the initial order of the frogs?
Note:
- Assume that a strict ordering by wrestling ability is possible.
- Billy Jean isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. Sometimes she has written the same two numbers for a pair. In this case, that frog is simply taken out and then put back.</div>
