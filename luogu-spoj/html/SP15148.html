<h1>POP2 - play with prime numbers (II)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
We define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is a prime number that consists of other prime numbers less than this number.
**Example:** 1013 consists of 101 and 3 and both are prime.
**Notes**: 2003 is not POP because leading zeros are not allowed.
The POP numbers must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping is not allowed .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. (T <= 200)
Followed by T lines, each line contains an integer m number 0 <= m <= 10 $ ^{18} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print single line contain the first integer greater than or equal to m and is (POP) .</div>
