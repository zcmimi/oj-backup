<h1>LCS2 - Longest Common Substring II </h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题面描述
给定一些字符串，求出它们的最长公共子串
输入格式
输入至多$10$ 行，每行包含不超过$100000$ 个的小写字母，表示一个字符串
输出格式
一个数，最长公共子串的长度
若不存在最长公共子串，请输出$0$ 。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A string is finite sequence of characters over a non-empty finite set Σ.
In this problem, Σ is the set of lowercase letters.
Substring, also called factor, is a consecutive sequence of characters occurrences at least once in a string.
Now your task is a bit harder, for some given strings, find the length of the longest common substring of them.
Here common substring means a substring of two or more strings.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains at most 10 lines, each line consists of no more than 100000 lowercase letters, representing a string.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The length of the longest common substring. If such string doesn't exist, print "0" instead.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
