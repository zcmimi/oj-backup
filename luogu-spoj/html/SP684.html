<h1>ASSIGN4 - Another Assignment Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Assume that you are a manager and there are m types of worker (numbered from 1 to m) and n types of task (numbered from 1 to n). There are a(i) workers of type #i and b(j) postitions for task #j. C(i, j) is the cost of hiring a worker of type #i to do the task of type #j. Your job is to minimize the cost of hiring workers to fill all the positions given that the total number of workers is equal to the total number of positions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input contains the number of test cases nTest (1<= nTest <= 10). Each test case contains:
- The first line contains the number of worker types - m and number of task types - n.
- The second line contains m positive integers: a(1), a(2), ..., a(m).
- The third line contains n positive integers: b(1), b(2), ..., b(n).
- Each of the next m lines contains n integers describing matrix C(i, j).
Notes:
1 <= m, n <= 200;
1 <= a(i), b(i) <= 30000;
1 <= C(i, j) <= 10000.
Sum of a(i) equals to sum of b(j).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case write the minimum cost in a separate line (it will fit in a signed 32-bit integer).</div>
