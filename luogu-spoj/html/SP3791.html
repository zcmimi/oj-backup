<h1>STREET - Street</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are **n** lots on one side of a street (where **n** k apartment buildings on these lots. Each building must occupy an interval of at most **t** consecutive lots. Moreover, each lot **i** has a height restriction **r\[i\]** (where **r\[i\]** i to **j** is:
**H = min{r\[i\], r\[i + 1\], ..., r\[j\]})**
Hence, the maximum usable facade space of the building is: **H × (j − i + 1)**. We would like to have a program to select at most **k** non-overlapping intervals to erect the buildings such that the total usable facade space is maximized.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input file is as follows: The first line contains three integers **n**, **k**, and **t** separated by a space character, where 1 n k t nlines contain **n** positive integers representing the height restriction for the **n** lots. For Example 1, the input file looks like:
```
10 2 4
7
3
12
11
13
4
8
6
6
20
```
The input should be read from the standard input, and your program will be run several times, each one with one of the test cases.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output file contains an integer which is the maximum usable facade space. For the above example, the output file looks like:
```
57
```
