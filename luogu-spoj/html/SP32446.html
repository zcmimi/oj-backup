<h1>SANVI - Sanvi and Magical Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let us define a **Magical number** as a positive integer number which meets the following criteria on its representation:
```
<pre style="padding: 9.5px; font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, "Courier New", monospace; font-size: 13px; color: #333333; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);">```
1.) It does not contain any zeros.
2.) Each digits may appears at most twice in it.
3.) The absolute differences between summation of count of non-prime digits and count of prime-digits do not exceed K.

```
```
Sanvi likes numbers which are not prime. So, **she wants to allow at most M non prime numbers to violate the rule number-2** . Sanvi also uses following algorithm in rule number-3 to calculate count of each digit **d** in a number:

 ```
<pre style="padding: 9.5px; font-family: Monaco, Menlo, Consolas, "Courier New", monospace; font-size: 13px; color: #333333; border-radius: 4px; margin: 0px 0px 20px; line-height: 20px; word-break: break-all; word-wrap: break-word; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #f5f5f5; border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);">```
count( d ) = min( total occurrences of d in number, 2 )

```
```
You are given an integer number **N**. Your task is to find the total Magical numbers in the range from **1** to **N** following Sanvi's command. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo **10^9+7**.</div>

    <h2>输入输出格式</h2>
    <h3>输入格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>Input contains several test cases up to **EOF** (End Of File), which contains three space separated integers **N ( 1  as described in the problem statement.Total test cases will not exceed **5**.**</div>
    <h3>输出格式</h3>
    <br />
    <div>Output a single integer denoting the total Magical numbers from **1 to N following Sanvi's command** . Since the answer could be very large print it modulo **10^9+7**.</div>

    <h2>输入输出样例</h2>
                        <h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
            <pre><code>10 1 0\n5 3 2</code></pre>
