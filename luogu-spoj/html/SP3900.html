<h1>MCQUERY - MinCut Query</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MCQUERY/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MCQUERY/vn/)You are given a weighted undirected graph with edge weight denoting the capacity of the edge.
Now given a number x, output how many unordered (s,t) pairs are there in the graph such that minCut(s,t) <= x.
A Cut is a partition of the vertices of a graph into two sets such that s and t belong to different set after the partition.
In weighted graphs, the size of a cut is defined to be the sum of weights of the edges crossing the cut. minCut is a cut whose size is the least possible.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T, the number of test cases.
For each test case the first line contains two integers n and m, denoting the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.
Next m lines contain 3 integers u,v,c denoting an undirected of capacity c between vertices u and v; 1 <= u,v <= n.
Next line contains q, the number of queries. Next q line contains one number each which denotes the input x for ith query.
Note: there can be multiple edges between a pair of vertices.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output for each test case should consist of q lines with one integers in each of them denoting the number of unordered (s,t) pairs corresponding to that query. Output a blank line BETWEEN the test cases.
Note: The timelimit for the problem is somewhat strict.</div>
