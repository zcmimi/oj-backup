<h1>IITKWPCI - Find Lexicographically Smallest Permutation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given n numbers a1, a2, , , an. You have to permute the numbers in such a way that resulting permutation should be lexicographically smallest . But there is a problem, you can not swap every pair of numbers. You can only swap the position i and j if they are good position. You will be given m pairs of i and j's which will denote good positions.
So complying to restrictions posed here, find the lexicographically smallest permutation of a1, a2, , , an.
Definition: (a1, a2. ... an) is lexicographically smaller than (b1, b2. .. bn) if first index i where ai and bi differs, ai < bi satisfies.
eg. (1, 2, 3, 4) is smaller than (2, 1, 3, 4)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>T : number of test cases (T <= 10)
Next Line will contain n and m. (1 <= n <= 10^3 and 0 <= m <= min (n \* (n - 1) / 2, 10^5).
Next Line will contains a1, a2, , , an. (a\[i\] >= 1 && a\[i\] <=10^6)
For next m lines, each line will contain i, j seperated by space which will denote that you can swap ai and aj.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output n numbers representing the permutation of a1, a2, , , an according to problem statement.</div>
