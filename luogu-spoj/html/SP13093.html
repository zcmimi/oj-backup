<h1>PCPC12G - Mosque</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Islam prayer in congregation (jama'ah) is considered to have more social and spiritual benefit than praying by oneself. When praying in congregation, the people stand in straight parallel rows behind the chosen imam, facing Qibla (The Qibla is the direction that should be faced when a Muslim prays). Sometimes some of these rows are cut by poles (n poles divide the row into n+1 parts), and some of the rows do not contain poles (the whole row is just one part). Muslims prefer to stand in the rows which are free of poles, so they may leave one row empty and use the next one if it has fewer poles, but they can’t leave two consecutive rows empty.</div>
