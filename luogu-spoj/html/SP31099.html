<h1>ADAROBOT - Ada and CAPTCHA</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug just got an inovative idea (which might be a rival of captcha): She made following function - **F(a)=least significant 1-bit of a** (indexed from 1). She also made following recursive function **T(N)=F(N\*(N-1)) $ ^{3} $ +T(N-2)**, where **T(0)=0,T(1)=0**.
Her idea is following- Instead of asking for captcha, she uses an opposite method: She gives you even **N** and you have to answer **T(N)** - if your answer is correct, then you are definetly robot and you won't be let in.
As her good friend she asked you to program a checker for her.</div>
