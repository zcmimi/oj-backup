<h1>YELBRICK - The Yellow Brick Road</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> After Dorothy’s memorable adventure in the Land of Oz, traffic along the Yellow Brick Road got really intense, making some sections of it nearly impossible to cross because of the holes along the road. The Land of Oz engineers are having trouble to pave this road, because the yellow stone is in short supply, forcing them to buy stones from different suppliers. As you already know, every road in the Land of Oz must be built using bricks that are perfect and identical cubes. To maximize the durability of the road, it also must be built using the least number of bricks possible. The problem is that each supplier provides stones of different sizes, that must be cut in order to make the bricks for the road.
Can you help the engineers to find which is the best brick size to use to maximize the road durability ?</div>
