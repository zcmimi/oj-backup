<h1>LOOPEXP - Loop Expectation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider the following pseudo-code
int a\[1..N\];
int max = -1;
for i = 1..N:
if(a\[i\] > max)
max = a\[i\];
Your task is to calculate the expected number of times the 'if' block of the above pseudo-code executes. The array 'a' is a random permutation of numbers from 1..N chosen uniformly at random.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains t, the number of test cases. t lines follow, each containing N, the number of elements in the array.
1<= t <= 100
1<= n <=100,000</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single decimal. Your answer should be within 10^-6 of the correct answer.</div>
