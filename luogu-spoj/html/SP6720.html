<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Sedrak likes making various things from paper (and he's very good at that). But after he finishes the job, his table is covered with a lot of useless creased, scrappy paper. Can he use them somehow?**

Each crease point is marked with as _mountain, valley,_ or _flat_ to specify the orientation of the crease (⋀,⋁,-). For example the input might look as follows:
