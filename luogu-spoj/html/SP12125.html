<h1>FIBOSQRT - Fibonacci With a Square Root</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>FIBONACCI is the recursive sequence that is given by: F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) with F(0)=0 and F(1)=1
In this problem we define FIBOSQRT that is given by: Fs(n)=Fs(n-1)+Fs(n-2)+2\*SQRT(3+Fs(n-1)\*Fs(n-2)) with Fs(0) and Fs(1) are given in the input file.
It's guaranteed that SQRT(3+Fs(n-1)\*Fs(n-2)) is always an integer. ![Wink](../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif "Wink") I've proved it by math theorem.
Now your task is to find Fs(n)
Since the number can be Big you have to find the result mod M.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is an integer T(1 T
For each test case, there are four integers **Fs(0)**,**Fs(1)**(1 M(1 M < 10 $ ^{9} $ ), and **n**(0 n < 10 $ ^{18} $ ) written in one line, separated by space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output Fs(**n**) mod **M**.</div>
