<h1>BASECONV - Base Conversion</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leo didn't do all the job in his [last problem](http://www.spoj.com/problems/DUKKAR2/), somebody gave him the numbers in a convenient base. It was the bottleneck of the problem... Now your task is to do this job.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains three integers **_T_**, the number of test cases, **_B1_**, the first base, **_B2_**, the second base. Follow 2×**_T_** lines. For each test case, on the first line your are given one integer **_k_**. On the second line you are given **_k_** integers : the digits of **_N_** in base **_B1_**. **_N = a $ _{0} $ ×B1 $ ^{0} $ + ... + a $ _{i} $ ×B1 $ ^{i} $ + ... + a $ _{k-1} $ ×B1 $ ^{k-1} $_**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you have to print the number **_N_** in base **_B2_**. See sample for details.</div>
