<h1>SIMPLEPATH - Simple Path</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You will be given a weighted rooted tree, where root is node 1. For each subtree of that tree, you will have to compute the summation of lengths of all possible simple paths present in that subtree. Eventually you need to print the summation of those values modulo **1000000007**.
Image of the tree in the first sample is given below.
![Image of the tree in the first sample is given below.](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP31342/428312a17dbb4c1d9ba923394206001d2cd3ca0b.png)
**Input Specification**
First line of input will contain an integer **T (1 <= T <= 10)** denoting the number of test cases. Each test case will begin with an integer **N (****1<= N <=100000****)**, indicating number of nodes. The following **N-1** lines will have three integers each, **U (1 <= U <= N)**, **V (1 <= V <= N)**, **W (1 <= W <= 1000000000)**, which denotes that there is an edge in the tree from node **U** to node **V** having **W** weight.
**Input File is large. Use fast I/O methods.**</div>
