<h1>MNERED - NERED</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/MNERED/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MNERED/vn/)In the nearby kindergarten they recently made up an attractive game of strength and agility that kids love. The surface for the game is a large flat area divided into N×N squares. The children lay large spongy cues onto the surface. The sides of the cubes are the same length as the sides of the squares. When a cube is put on the surface, its sides are aligned with some square. A cube may be put on another cube too. Kids enjoy building forts and hiding them, but they always leave behind a huge mess. Because of this, prior to closing the kindergarten, the teachers rearrange all the cubes so that they occupy a rectangle on the surface, with exactly one cube on every square in the rectangle. In one moving, a cube is taken off the top of a square to the top of any other square.
Write a program that, given the state of the surface, calculates the smallest number of moves needed to arrange all cubes into a rectangle.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the integers N and M (1 ≤ N ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ N^2), the dimensions of the surface and the number of cubes currently on the surface.
Each of the following M lines contains two integers R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ N), the coordinates of the square that contains the cube.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the smallest number of moves. A solution will always exist.</div>
