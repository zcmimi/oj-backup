<h1>MAIN12C - Email ID</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everyone loves Swampy. Swampy the Alligator lives under the city and yearns for a more human like existence. One day Swampy thought to learn the intricacies of the internet. He went to a book store in SwampVille immediately and bought a book on "Basic Internet". After reading the book Swampy decided to try on some exercises. The exercise demanded Swampy to report all valid email-id's in a given free-form text string. Check output section for exact specification.

The username cannot start from '.' or '\_' The site-address is build of a prefix which is non-empty string build from characters {a-z A-Z 0-9} (excluding the brackets) followed by one of the following suffixes {".com", ".org", "edu", ".co.in"}. There is no space character in the email-id. The entire email-id is "username@site-address".</div>
