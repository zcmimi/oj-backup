<h1>PSTR - Number of Prime Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A string is called a "prime string" if it can't be written as concatenation of more than one same strings. For example, the following strings are not prime strings: AAA, ABABAB, CFGFGCFGFG, while CFGFGC, ABABA are prime strings.
Calculate the number of prime string of length N (1<=N<=1000000), and only contains first K (1<=K<=26) letters from English alphabet. Note that some of these K letters need not appear in that string.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases. The number of them (about 10000) is given in the very first line.
Each test case contains one line with two integers - K and N, seperated by a single space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output the required number modulo 1000000007 in a single line.
Example
```
Input:
1
2 3
Output:
6
Explanation
The prime strings of length 3 which only contain character 'A' and 'B' are: AAB,ABA,ABB,BAA,BAB,BBA.
