<h1>ORDSUM23 - Sums of 2 and 3</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有T组数据，每组数据需要读入一个数，输出这个数用2或3的和表示的结果。
如：8=2+2+2+2=2+3+3=3+2+3=3+3+2
样例：I:3 2 3 8
O:1 1 4</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Changu and Mangu are brothers. Changu likes 2 and Mangu likes 3. They decided to express each number as sum of 2 and 3.
They need your help. They want you to tell them the number of ways of writing a number as ordered sums of 2 and/or 3.
For example, there are 4 ways to write 8 as an ordered sum of 2s and/or 3s:
2 + 2 + 2 + 2
2 + 3 + 3
3 + 2 + 3
3 + 3 + 2</div>
