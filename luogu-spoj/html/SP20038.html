<h1>SNGLOOP1 - Easiest Loop 1</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Ileana D'Cruz is taking programming classes but she is having problem in understanding **while loops**. She is working on following set of instructions -
INTEGER **I = 0, S, U = 10 $ ^{10} $** ;
**WHILE** (I < U) **{**
S = (3 \* S) + (5 \* I);
I = I + 1;
**}**
Let **S $ _{k} $** be the value assigned to INTEGER **S** for the iteration **I = (k + 1)** and **n, m, p** be positive integers such that **m > n.** Ileana knows the values of **n** and **m** but she forgot the initial value of **S**. She is trying to find the unit digit of **p**. Any initial value of S may be used. She also knows the following equality -
**(2 \* n + 3) \* (p - 1) **+** (4 / 5) \* \[(p \* S $ _{n} $ ) - S $ _{m} $ \] **=** 2 \* (m - n)**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input is **T**(total no. of test cases). Each of next T lines contains two integers **n** and **m**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print **unit digit of p (p % 10)** for each test case in separated lines.</div>
