<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
两组穴居人陷入土地纠纷，决定用老办法解决，互相扔棍子。这场战斗是在一个山洞里组织的，山洞的高度足以让天花板不受影响，但地面上的矿藏阻碍了棍子的飞行。
洞穴可分为r行和c列，整个洞穴由r×c细胞组成。洞穴中的每个细胞要么是空的，要么含有一大块矿物。如果两块矿物在四个主要方向（上、下、左、右）中的一个方向相邻，则它们是同一簇矿物的一部分。
一组洞穴人在洞穴的左侧，另一组在右侧。两组轮流向另一组投掷棍子；首先一组选择棍子飞行的高度，然后（必要时相互攀爬）投掷棍子，棍子在选定的高度水平穿过洞穴。
如果棍子在路上碰到一块矿物，它就会破坏这块矿物，细胞变空，棍子就会停止它的旅程。
当一个块被销毁时，集群可能会崩溃。如果一个新创建的星团会漂浮在空中，那么它会因为重力而坠落。落下时，簇不会改变形状，即簇中的所有块都落在一起。一旦坠落星团中的某个星团落在另一个星团或地面的某个星团上，整个星团就会停止坠落。就我们而言，如果一个集群落在另一个集群上，它们就会合并成为一个集群。
你的程序将给出洞穴中矿物的布局和投掷棍棒的高度。交换木棒后，确定矿物的布局。
输入格式
第一行包含两个整数r和c（1≤r，c≤100），即洞穴的尺寸。
下面的每一行r都将包含c字符。字符“.”表示空单元格，而字母“x”表示矿物块。
下一行包含一个整数n（1≤n≤100），即抛出的棍子数。
最后一行包含n个整数，用空格隔开，空格是指投掷棍子的高度。所有高度都在1到R之间（包括1和R），高度1是矩阵的底部，高度R是顶部。第一个勾号从左到右，第二个从右到左，依此类推。
一开始不会有集群漂浮在空中。此外，输入数据将使两个或多个集群在任何时候都不会同时下降，从而不会出现不明确的情况。
输出格式
输出应该由r行组成，每行包含c个字符，洞的最终布局与输入的格式相同。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two groups of cavemen got into a land dispute and decided to settle it the old fashion-way, by throwing sticks at each other. The fight was organized in a cave, high enough that the ceiling is of no concern, but mineral deposits on the ground get in the way of flying sticks.
The cave can be divided into R rows and C columns, so that the entire cave consists of R×C cells. Each cell in the cave is either empty or contains a chunk of mineral. Two chunks of minerals are part of the same cluster if they are adjacent in one of the four main directions (up, down, left, right).
One group of cavemen is on the left side of the cave, the other on the right side. The groups alternate throwing sticks at the other group; first a group chooses the height at which the stick will fly and then (climbing on each others' shoulders as necessary) they throw it and the stick flies horizontally through the cave at the chosen height.
If the stick hits a chunk of mineral on the way, it destroys the chunk, the cell becomes empty and the stick stops its journey.
When a chunk is destroyed, it is possible that a cluster falls apart. If a newly created cluster would float in the air, then it falls down because of gravity. While falling, the cluster does not change shape i.e. all chunks in it fall together. As soon as some chunk in the falling cluster lands on a chunk from a different cluster or the ground, the entire cluster stops falling. Of ourse, if a cluster lands on another, they merge and become one.
Your program will be given the layout of minerals in the cave and the heights at which sticks were thrown. Determine the layout of minerals after the sticks are exchanged.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ 100), the dimensions of the cave.
Each of the following R lines will contain C characters. The character '.' represents an empty cell, while the letter 'x' represents a chunk of mineral.
The next line contains an integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100), the number of sticks thrown.
The last line contains N integers separated by spaces, the heights at which sticks were thrown. All heights will be between 1 and R (inclusive), with height 1 being the bottom of the matrix and height R the top. The first tick is thrown left to right, the second right to left and so on.
No cluster will initially float in the air. Also, the input data will be such that at no point will two or more clusters fall simultaneously, so that there will be no ambiguous situations.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output should consist of R lines, each containing C characters, the final layout of the cave, in the same format as in the input.</div>
