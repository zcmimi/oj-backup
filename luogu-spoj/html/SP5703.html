<h1>LPRIME - Primes of Lambda</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[Lambda](../../../users/tonyxty/) checks primality in a weird way. He checks the following two conditions.
- All the digits of the number in the decimal system are primes or one, namely 1, 2, 3, 5 or 7.
- It isn't a multiple of 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 or 47 (Why 47? I don't know).
In order to estimate the accuracy of his approach, he asks you to calculate the number of decimal integers of a specific length that satisfy the conditions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
