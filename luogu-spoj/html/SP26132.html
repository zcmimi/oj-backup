<h1>SUMDEC2 - Sum the Decimal-part II</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**A much easier version of this problem can be found here-[SUMDEC1](http://www.spoj.com/problems/SUMDEC1/).
In case you haven't tried it out,try the first part.**
In this problem,You are given a number.You need to output the sum of the first 1000 decimal places of the square-root of the number(Ignore the Integral part).
For example-if the given number is 2. The square-root of 2 is 1.4142135623.....
So,ignore the number before decimal (1 in this case) and add the first 1000 digits after decimal and output them as result-4482.(in this case)
**NOTE-If the number is a perfect square,the output should be 0.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>the first line of input consist of t (the number of test cases).
t lines follow-Each line consist of a non-negative integer n.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output in seperate lines the result corresponding to integer n.
#### Constraints
1<=t<=100
