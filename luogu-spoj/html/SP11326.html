<h1>ARTHEVAL - Arithmetic Evaluation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Evaluate a parenthesized expression of single-digit positive integers and the binary operators +, -, \*.
The order of operations differs from the canonical one in that operations have no precedence; they are simply evaluated from left-to-right, with only parentheses affecting the order of evaluation.
Every intermediate step is guaranteed to have absolute value no greater than 1,000,000,000.
**Input:**
Input is an arithmetic expression of single-digit positive integers, the binary operators +,-, \* and parentheses (). The arithmetic expression will be well-formed and will have no spaces.
**Output:**
The evaluated value of the arithmetic expression.
**Example Input 1:** **Example Input 2:** **Example Input 3:** ```
1*2+1
```
```
1+1*2
```
```
(5*6)-(40+(1))
```
**Example Output 1:** **Example Output 2:** **Example Output 3:** ```
