<h1>HEAPULM - Binary Search Heap Construction</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Read the statement of problem G for the definitions concerning trees. In the following we define the basic terminology of heaps. A **heap** is a tree whose internal nodes have each assigned a **priority** (a number) such that the priority of each internal node is less than the priority of its parent. As a consequence, the root has the greatest priority in the tree, which is one of the reasons why heaps can be used for the implementation of priority queues and for sorting.
A binary tree in which each internal node has both a label and a priority, and which is both a binary search tree with respect to the labels and a heap with respect to the priorities, is called a **treap**. Your task is, given a set of label-priority-pairs, with unique labels and unique priorities, to construct a treap containing this data.</div>
