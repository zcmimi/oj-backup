<h1>BSPRIME - Binary Sequence of Prime Number</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Binary Sequence of Prime Number is a binary sequence that created by converting prime number to base-2 (Without leading zeros):
(2) $ _{10} $ =(10) $ _{2} $
(3) $ _{10} $ =(11) $ _{2} $
(5) $ _{10} $ =(101) $ _{2} $
(7) $ _{10} $ =(111) $ _{2} $
...
If all base-2 of prime number joined, then we get the binary sequence like this: 10111011111011110110...
Now your task is to count how many digit '1' appear in the first **N** terms of the sequence, example:
\-->If N=3, digit '1' appear 2 times: 101110...
\-->If N=10, digit '1' appear 8 times: 1011101111101...</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
