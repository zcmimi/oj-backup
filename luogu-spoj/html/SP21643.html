<h1>UNHAPPY - Unhappy Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Numbers have feelings too! For any positive integer, take the sum of the squares of each of its digits, and add them together. Take the result, and do it again. A number is Happy if, after repeating this process a finite number of times, the sum is 1. Some happy numbers take more iterations of this process to get to 1 than others, and that would be referred to as its distance from happiness. 1’s distance from happiness is 0. 23’s distance from happiness is 3, since 2 $ ^{2} $ + 3 $ ^{2} $ = 13, 1 $ ^{2} $ + 3 $ ^{2} $ = 10, and 1 $ ^{2} $ + 0 $ ^{2} $ = 1. Numbers are Unhappy if they are infinitely far away from happiness because they get stuck in a loop.
Given the lower end and upper end of a range of integers, determine how many Unhappy numbers are in that range (inclusive).</div>
