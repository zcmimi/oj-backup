<h1>MIXTURES - Mixtures</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
哈利·波特在他面前有n个混合物，排列成一排。每种混合物都有100种不同颜色之一（颜色的数字从0到99）。
他想把所有这些混合物混合在一起。在每个步骤中，他将采取两个彼此相邻的混合物并将它们混合在一起，并将所得到的混合物置于其中。
当混合两种颜色a和b的混合物时，得到的混合物将具有颜色（a + b）mod 100。
而且，在这个过程中会有一些烟雾。当混合两种颜色a和b的混合物时产生的烟雾的量是a * b。
找出混合所有混合物时Harry能得到的最小烟雾量。
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入中会有一些测试用例。
每个测试用例的第一行将包含n，即混合物的数量，1 <= n <= 100。
第二行将包含0到99之间的n个整数 - 混合物的初始颜色。
输出格式：
对于每个测试案例，输出最小量的烟雾。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Harry Potter has n mixtures in front of him, arranged in a row. Each mixture has one of 100 different colors (colors have numbers from 0 to 99).
He wants to mix all these mixtures together. At each step, he is going to take two mixtures that stand next to each other and mix them together, and put the resulting mixture in their place.
When mixing two mixtures of colors a and b, the resulting mixture will have the color (a+b) mod 100.
Also, there will be some smoke in the process. The amount of smoke generated when mixing two mixtures of colors a and b is a\*b.
Find out what is the minimum amount of smoke that Harry can get when mixing all the mixtures together.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There will be a number of test cases in the input.
