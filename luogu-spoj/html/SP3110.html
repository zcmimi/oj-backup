<h1>PALNUM - Palindromic Number</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A postive integer A is called a "palindrome number" if the reverse of the decimal representaion is the same as the original one. Ex. 13231 is a palindrome number, but 13333 is not.
Given a number A(1 <= A <= 1e18), find the number of pairs (a,b) such that a,b are both palindrome numbers, and the sum of a and b is A.
If A is 391, there are 6 ways: 8 + 383 = 383 + 8 = 391 88 + 303 = 303 + 88 = 391 99 + 292 = 292 + 99 = 391</div>
