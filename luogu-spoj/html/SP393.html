<h1>HEXAGON - Hexagon</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有一个由19个六角板组成的游戏板，如下图所示。我们可以依据游戏板的形状区分三个方向：从上到下，从左上到右下，从右上到左下。对于每个方向，游戏板可以被看作是由3, 4, 5，4和3块板组成的几列。(游戏板完全由六角板组成。)
每块都带有三个数字，在每一板上相对的边有相同的数字。每个方向只有三个不同的数字。一块板包含所有三个方向的三个数字的每个合法组合之一，从而产生一组27个独特的片段。（上图中的一部分版仍处于被覆盖的过程中。）
板的得分计算为所有15个行得分的总和（每个方向为5行）。行分数计算如下：如果一行中的所有板对于行的方向具有相同的数字，则行分数是该数字乘以该行中的板数。否则（板在行方向上有不同的数字）得分为零。注意，这些板无法旋转。例如，图中最左边一列的分数是3乘3=9，次左行的分数是4乘11=44。
在真实游戏中，板是随机选择的，且这些板是固定的。我们感兴趣的在以上条件下是每个方向的给定数字的最高分。这意味着你必须选择那些在约束条件下得分最高的19个板，每个游戏板的得分大于零。
## 输入输出格式
#### 输入格式：
输入文件的第一行包含一个整数n，表示测试样例数量。每个测试样例由三行组成，每行包含三个不同的正整数。这三行中的每一行都包含一个方向的数。组合数字生成一组板。
#### 输出格式：
对于每个测试用例，输出一行包含案例编号（“Test #1”，“ Test #2”等），然后是最高可能分数。在每个测试样例后添加一个空行。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider a game board consisting of 19 hexagonal fields, as shown in the figure below. We can easily distinguish three main directions in the shape of the board: from top to bottom, from top-left to bottom-right, and from top-right to bottom-left. For each of these primary directions, the board can be viewed as a series of rows, consisting of 3, 4, 5, 4, and 3 fields, respectively.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP393/283e1364de53c40ec003ee9ef374f8320dd12567.png)The game board has to be completely covered using a set of hexagonal pieces. Each piece carries three numbers, one for every primary board direction. Only three different numbers are used for each direction. Every possible combination of three numbers for all three directions is assigned to a piece, leading to a set of 27 unique pieces. (The board in the above figure is still in the process of being covered.)
The score of a board is calculated as the sum of all 15 row scores (5 rows for each primary direction). The row scores are calculated as follows: if all pieces in a row carry the same number for the direction of the row, the row score is this number multiplied by the number of pieces in the row. Otherwise (the pieces carry different numbers in the row direction) the row score is zero. Note that the pieces may not be rotated. For example, the score of the leftmost row in the figure is 3 $ ^{.} $ 3 = 9, the score of the row to its right is 4 $ ^{.} $ 11 = 44.
While in the real game the pieces are chosen randomly and the set of pieces is fixed, we are interested in the highest possible score for a given set of numbers for each direction, when all pieces in a row carry the same number for the direction of the row. This means you have to choose those 19 pieces that result in the highest score under the constraint that each row has a score greater than zero.</div>

<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains an integer **n** which indicates the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines containing three different positive integers each. Each of these three lines contains the numbers for a single primary direction. From these numbers the set of pieces is generated.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a line containing the number of the case ("Test #1", "Test #2", etc.), followed by a line containing the highest possible score for the given numbers. Add a blank line after each test case.</div>
