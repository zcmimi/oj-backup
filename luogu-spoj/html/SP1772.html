<h1>DETER2 - Find The Determinant II</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem you have to calculate the determinant of an N x N matrix whose entries are given by **m\[i\]\[j\] = gcd(i,j) $ ^{k} $** , 1 ≤ i,j ≤ N.
Here gcd(i,j) denotes the greatest common divisor of i and j.
As the determinant D can grow very large, you have to print D%1000003.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input consists of a single integer containing the number of test cases T ( equal to around 20), each of the following T lines contain two integers N and k where N is the size of the matrix and k is the exponent.
1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
1 ≤ k ≤ 10 $ ^{9} $</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>One line corresponding to each test case containing the determinant modulo 1000003 for the corresponding test case.</div>
