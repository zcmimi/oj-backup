<h1>BEENUMS - Beehive Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A beehive is an enclosed structure in which some honey bee species live and raise their
young. In this problem we consider a two-dimensional sketch of the beehives. Each
beehive is composed of a certain number of cells, where each cell is a regular hexagon.
Each cell may have some neighbors, which are other cells that share a side with that cell.
A cell with exactly 6 neighbors is an internal cell, while a cell with fewer neighbors is an
external one. Notice that an external cell can always be changed to internal by adding
some neighbor cells.
We are interested in a particular class of beehives. This class of valid beehives is defined
recursively as follows: a) a single cell is a valid beehive; and b) given a valid beehive B,
if we add the minimum number of cells such that each external cell of B becomes an
internal cell, the result is a valid beehive.
The number of cells in a valid beehive is called a beehive number. Given an integer N ,
you must decide whether it is a beehive number.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each test case is described using a single line. The line contains an integer N (1 10 $ ^{9} $ ). The end of input is indicated with a line containing a single −1.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single line containing an uppercase “Y” if N is a beehive
number, or an uppercase “N” otherwise.</div>
