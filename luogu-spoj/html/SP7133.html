<h1>IOIGARD - Garden 2005</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Byteman owns the most beautiful garden in Bytetown. He planted n roses in his garden. Summer has come</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of standard input contains two integers: l and w (1<=l,w<=250) separated by a single space — the length and the width of the garden. The second line contains two integers: n and k (2<=n<=5000, 1<=k<=n/2) separated by a single space — the number of roses in the garden and the number of roses that should be in each of the rectangular areas. The following n lines contain the coordinates of the roses, one rose per line. The (i+2)-nd line contains two integers li, wi (1<=li<=l, 1<=wi<=w) separated by a single space — the coordinates of the square containing the i-th rose. Two or more roses can occur in the same square.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The standard output should contain only one line with exactly one integer—the minimum sum of perimeters of two non-overlapping rectangular areas, each containing exactly k roses, or a single word NO, if no such pair of areas exists.</div>
