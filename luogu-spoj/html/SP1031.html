<h1>UPSUB - Up Subsequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>If x = a $ _{0} $ a $ _{1} $ a $ _{2} $ ...a $ _{n-1} $ is a string where a $ _{i} $ denotes the character at index i, a subsequence a $ _{j0} $ a $ _{j1} $ a $ _{j2} $ ...a $ _{jn} $ is called an upsubsequence if a $ _{j0} $ <= a $ _{j1} $ <= a $ _{j2} $ <= ... <= a $ _{jn} $ and j0 < j1 < j2 < ... < jn.
A maximal upsubsequence of a string is defined as the upsubsequence of maximum length. BuggyD observes that a string **x** can have many maximal upsubsequences. Help him find all the maximal upsubsequences in **x**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer **t**, the number of test cases. **t** test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single line containing a string **x**, where the length of **x** is no more than 100. **x** will not contain any spaces, tabs or other whitespace characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test csae, output all of the maximal upsubsequences of **x** in lexicographical order. Print a blank line after each test case.</div>
