<h1>LEXSTR - Lexicographically Smallest</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Taplu and Abhishar loved playing scrabble. One day they thought of inventing a new game using alphabet tiles. Abhishar wrote a string using tiles and gave a set of pairs (i,j) to Taplu. Pair “i, j” (0 based indexing) means that Taplu can swap the i’th and j’th tile in the string any number of times. He then asks Taplu to give the lexicographically smallest string that can be produced by doing any number of swaps on the original string.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T(1<=T<=10), the number of testcases.
First line of each test case contains the initial string S. Length of Sttring is len(1<=len<=100000).
Next line contains the number of pairs M (1<=M<=100000).
Next M lines contains pairs i j that means ith character can be swapped with jth character.
Note - i and j can be same and same i,j pair can occur twice.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each testcase output the lexicographically smallest string that can be made from the initial string.</div>
