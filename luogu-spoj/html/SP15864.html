Find the sum of $x$ smallest distinct numbers of the series $2^i \\times 3^j$ ($i, j \\ge 0$).
- the first number of the series is $1 = 2^0 \\times 3^0$
- the second number of the series is $2 = 2^1 \\times 3^0$
- the third number of the series is $3 = 2^0 \\times 3^1$
- the fourth number of the series is $4 = 2^2 \\times 3^0$
- the fifth number of the series is $6 = 2^1 \\times 3^1$
As the sum can be huge print sum **modulo** $k$.</div>
