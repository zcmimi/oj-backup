<h1>MARBLES - Marbles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>汉斯梦见他在一家拥有无数弹珠的商店里，有k种颜色的弹珠，他可以在其中选择n个，每一种颜色的弹珠都有无数颗。汉斯希望每一种颜色的弹珠至少有一颗，但他的选择仍有很多种可能。当他正在努力做出决定时，他醒了。现在汉斯想知道，他有多少种选择。假设相同颜色的弹珠无法区分，弹珠的顺序也无关紧要</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Hänschen dreams he is in a shop with an infinite amount of marbles. He is allowed to select n marbles. There are marbles of k different colors. From each color there are also infinitely many marbles. Hänschen wants to have at least one marble of each color, but still there are a lot of possibilities for his selection. In his effort to make a decision he wakes up. Now he asks you how many possibilites for his selection he would have had. Assume that marbles of equal color can't be distinguished, and the order of the marbles is irrelevant.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input contains a number T <= 100 that indicates the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of one line containing n and k, where n is the number of marbles Hänschen selects and k is the number of different colors of the marbles. You can assume that 1<=k<=n<=1000000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case print the number of possibilities that Hänschen would have had. You can assume that this number fits into a signed 64 bit integer.</div>
