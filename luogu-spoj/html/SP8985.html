<h1>KOILINE - Line up</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>N people are lined up in a straight line to enter a concert. Each person in this line knows how many people in front have shorter or same heights. Let's call the sequence representing these numbers S. So in other words, S\[i\] means that there are S\[i\] people in front of the ith person who have shorter or same heights than that of person i.
Given the heights of N people and a sequence S, determine the correct order of people lined up. (left is front)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input is an integer N. (1<=N<=100,000)
The next N lines each consists of one integer H. (1<=H<=2\*10^9) These N integers are the heights of people lined up.
Then, sequence S is given in a single line, separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Determine the correct ordering of people lined up. Total of N lines should be output. The integer on the ith line represents the height of the ith person in the line.</div>
