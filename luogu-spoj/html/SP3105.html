<h1>MOD - Power Modulo Inverted</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求最小的$y$使得$k ≡ x^y (mod \ z)$
无解输出"No Solution"
$k,y,x\in[1,10^9]$
translated by yler </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given 3 positive integers _x_, _y_ and _z_, you can find _k = x $ ^{y} $ %z_ easily, by fast power-modulo algorithm. Now your task is the inverse of this algorithm. Given 3 positive integers _x_, _z_ and _k_, find the smallest non-negative integer _y_, such that _k%z = x $ ^{y} $ %z_.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>About 600 test cases.
Each test case contains one line with 3 integers _x_, _z_ and _k_.(1<= _x_, _z_, _k_ <=10 $ ^{9} $ )
Input terminates by three zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line with the answer, or "No Solution"(without quotes) if such an integer doesn't exist.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
