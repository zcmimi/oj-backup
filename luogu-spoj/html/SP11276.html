<h1>ADVNTURE - Adventure</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Rand has been sitting in a spaceship at the point (0,0,0) for a long time. One day, he got bored and decided to undertake an adventure.
Deciding upon an adventure has several complicated steps. First, Rand chooses a destination point (x,y,z) different from (0,0,0) such that 0<=x<=A, 0<=y<=B, 0<=z<=C. To go to this point, Rand travels in a straight line from the origin. As a result, he might encounter several other lattice points in the way. Each part of the journey between two consecutive lattice points encountered is called a phase.( For example if (x,y,z)=(1,2,3) then there is only one phase (0,0,0)->(1,2,3), while if (x,y,z)=(3,0,3) then there are 3 phases (0,0,0)->(1,0,1)->(2,0,2)->(3,0,3) ).
In each phase Rand chooses one of K different activities that he can undertake to pass the time. You need to calculate the total number of different adventures possible, modulo 1000000007 (1e9+7). Two adventures are considered different if they have different destination points, or if the activity undertaken during any of the corresponding phases is different.</div>
