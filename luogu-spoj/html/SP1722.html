<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
这个问题非常考验你的数学知识和编程能力。您的任务是计算一个特殊的无向无权图的不同最小生成树(MST)的数目。图中有n个从1到n的节点，在节点i(1<=i<=n)和节点j(1<=j<=n)之间有一个边当且仅当0
输入输出格式
输入格式：
一行一个数a，表明有a次询问(a<=8)。
接下来a行，每行有两个空格分隔数k(1<=k<=5)和n(1<=n<=10^15)。
表示一个特殊的无向无权图。
输出格式：
对于每个测试用例，您应该输出一行，对应不同MST的数量对65521取模。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This problem tests your mathematic knowledge and your programming ability very much. Your task is to calculate the number of different Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) of a special undirected unweighted graph. The graph has n nodes numbered from 1 to n, and there is an edge between node i (1<=i<=n) and node j (1<=j<=n) if and only if 0<|i-j|<=k.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases, the number of them(<=8) is given in the very first line.
Each test case contains one line with two space-separated numbers k(1<=k<=5) and n(1<=n<=10 $ ^{15} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case you should output one line, the number of different MSTs of the corresponding graph modulo 65521.</div>
