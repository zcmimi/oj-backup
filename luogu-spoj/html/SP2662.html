<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases, the number of them is given in the very first line.
For each test case:
The first line contains 3 space-separated integers K(2<=K<=30), S(2<=S<=10000), M(0<=M<=20). M lines follow, each contains K non-negative integers a $ _{ij} $ (1<=i<=M, 1<=j<=K), which shows that there is one point (a $ _{i1} $ , a $ _{i2} $ , ... a $ _{ik} $ ) in the K-D hyperspace. No two point will be the same, and none of them lies on any (coordinate) axis.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case:
Output a single integer which shows the number of the points B(b $ _{1} $ , b $ _{2} $ , ... b $ _{k} $ ) in the hyperspace satiesfied the following constraints:
- B is not on any (coordinate) axis.
- For each 1<= _i_ <= M, there exist _j_, 1<=j<=k, such that b $ _{j} $ < a $ _{ij} $ .
- For each 1<=j<=k, b $ _{j} $ is a non-negative integer.
- The sum of b $ _{j} $ doesn't exceed S.</div>
