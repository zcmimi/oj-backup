<h1>ADAGAME4 - Ada and Game of Divisors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug is playing **Game of Divisors** against her friend Velvet Mite Vinit. The game has following rules. There is a pile of **N** stones between them. The player who's on move can pick at least **1** an at most **σ(N)** stones (where **σ(N)** stands for number of divisors of **N**). Obviously, **N** changes after each move. The one who won't get any stones (**N == 0**) loses.
As Ada the **Lady**bug is a lady, so she moves first. Can you decide who will be the winner? Assume that both players play optimally.</div>
