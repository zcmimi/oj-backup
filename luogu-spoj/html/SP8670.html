<div># 题目简述
在半径为r的半圆上找一个点A，使得这一个点到半圆的一个端点的距离平方+这一个点到半圆的另一个点的距离最短
# 输入格式
第一行T
第2~T+1行 每行一个r

$1<=r<=10^6$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem you will be given a half-circle. The half-circle’s radius is _r_. You can take any point A on the half-circle and draw 2 lines from the point to the two sides of the diameter(AB and AC). Let the sum of square of one line’s length and the other line’s length is _s_

Now given _r_ you have to find the maximum value of _s_. That is you have to find point A such that _AB_ $ ^{2} $ + _AC_ is maximum.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> First line of the test case will be the number of test case T (1 <= T <= 1000). Then T lines follows. On each line you will find a integer number _r_ (1 <= _r_ <= 1000000); each representing the radius of the half-circle.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input line, print a line containing "Case I: ", where I is the test case number and the maximum value of _s_. Print 2 digit after decimal (Errors should be less then .01).</div>
