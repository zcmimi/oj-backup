<h1>PT07X - Vertex Cover</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
给定一棵无权无向树，求出这棵树的最小点覆盖。
## 输入格式
第1行：一个正整数$N$，表示这棵树的大小
接下来$n-1$行，每行2个正整数$x,y$，表示结点$x,y$之间有一条边
## 输出格式
输出共1行，一个正整数，表示最小点覆盖的点个数。
## 数据规模与约定
$n\le10^5$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to find a vertex set of minimum size in this tree such that each edge has as least one of its end-points in that set.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ --- number of nodes in the tree (0 < _N_ <= 100000). Next _N_-1 lines contain _N_-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (_u_, _v_) means there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_ (1 <= _u_,_v_ <= _N_).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Print number of nodes in the satisfied vertex set on one line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
