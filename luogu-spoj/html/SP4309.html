<h1>AE5A1 - Circular game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/AE5A1/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/AE5A1/vn/)In the ”circular game” the board consists of m fields arranged on a circle and numbered from 1 to m. On the board there are b white and c black pieces, at most one on each field. Two players are playing the game, the white player and the black player. Starting from the white player, the players perform their moves on the board alternately. A move consists of moving a piece of the player’s colour any number of free fields forward or backward. For instance, for the board depicted below, the white player can move the piece from field 3 to field 4 or the piece from field 8 to any of the fields 7, 9 and 1.

If a player can perform no moves in his turn, he loses. Knowing that both players play optimally, check who wins the game. It can happen that none of the players wins (the game never ends).</div>
