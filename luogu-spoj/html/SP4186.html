<h1>HS08CODE - Break a New RSA system</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today, Gerrob's RSA company has featured a New RSA cryptosystem: its public key is _n_, the secret keys are three distinct primes _p_, _q_ and _r_, where _n_=_p_\*_q_\*_r_. Note that the ordinary RSA uses only 2 primes! Unfortunately some hackers have stolen a DVD from the company. It does not store the secret keys, only some information about the system, namely, the values of:
φ (_n_) - Euler's totient function and
σ (_n_) - the sum of the divisors.
Obviously you know also _n_, because that's public.
Now, Gerrob's RSA employees are trying to determine if hackers will be able to break the system. Could you help them to answer this question?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer _T_, the number of test cases, where _T_≤ 20000. The following _T_ lines each contains three numbers n, φ (_n_) and σ (_n_) in this order. There are 5 input sets.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output _T_ lines, the values of _p_, _q_ and _r_ in increasing order. It is guaranteed that _p_, _q_, _r_<10 $ ^{6} $ .</div>
