<h1>HQNP - HQNP Incomputable</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>HQ9+ is an esoteric programming language specialized for certain tasks. For example, printing “Hello,world!” or writing a quine (a program that prints itself) couldn’t be any simpler. Unfortunately, HQ9+ doesn’t do very well in most other situations. This is why we have created our own variant of the language,HQ0-9+−INCOMPUTABLE?!.A HQ0-9+−INCOMPUTABLE?! program is a sequence of commands, written on one line without any whitespace (except for the trailing newline). The program can store data in two memory areas: the buffer, a string of characters, and the accumulator, an integer variable. Initially, the buffer is empty and the accumulator is set to 0. The value of the buffer after executing all the commands becomes the program’s output.</div>
