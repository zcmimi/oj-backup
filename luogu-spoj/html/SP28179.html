<h1>GOC11A - Appending String</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string S, you need to build another string T by expanding S according to the steps below (traversing left to right):
1. If current character is an alphabet, append it to T.
2. If current character is a digit, suppose the digit is N, then do T = N\*T. Here N\*T means appending T N times. See sample for better understanding.
3. Go to next character if exists then restart from step 1.
Upon expanding S, you will be given Q queries. For each query you have to print the i $ _{th} $ character of the string T.
Hint : After expanding the string S=”a3b2c1” T will be = “aaabaaabc”</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line will be the test case number(t<=10).
In the first line of each test you will be given a string consisting of lowercase letters and digits. And it is guaranteed that length of T will be no more than 1000.
Next line will contain an integer Q(<=100000) denoting total numbers of queries. Following Q lines each contains an integer X.
Output
<a name="_GoBack"></a> For each query X, you have to print the X $ _{th} $ character of T in a line. If X is greater than the length of T, print -1.</div>
