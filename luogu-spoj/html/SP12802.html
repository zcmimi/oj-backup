<h1>TRI2 - Yet Another Counting Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a piece of iron wire with length of **n** unit. Now you decide to cut it into several ordered pieces and fold each piece into a triangle satisfying that all triangles are **integral** and pairwise **similar**.
count the number of different approaches to form triangles. Two approaches are considered different if they produce different numbers of triangles, and/or there exists _i_ that the _i_-th (again, pieces are ordered) triangle in one approaches is not **congruent** to _i_th triangle in another plan.
Since the answer can be very large, output the answer modules 1000000007.
**Solve this problem by at most 0.5 KB of source code.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each test case consists of one line containing one integer n (1<=n<=5,000,000). Process until EOF is reached.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line. See the example for more format details.</div>
