<h1>CWB - Chipmunks with Brain</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a Chipmunk with **"Brain"** and he want to dig holes in a yard to store his food.
There is a rectangular yard which is divided into unit cells, initially having some holes**(H)** and sand**(S)**. The chipmunk can dig one row at a time, But he have to dig all the sand(S) positions simultanously and due to this holes(H) which are already there got filled with sand.
Example:
Suppose a Row is **"SHSHH"** then after digging the row becomes **"HSHSS" i.e all "S" replace with "H" and vice versa**.
Now Chipmunk wants to have a **large square of holes** somewhere in the yard. The sides of square must be parallel to the sides of the yard. Find a sequence of turns that produces the largest possible square of holes somewhere in the yard and help him to find the area of that square.</div>
