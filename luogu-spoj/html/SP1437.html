<h1>PT07Z - Longest path in a tree</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
给你一个无权无向的树。编写程序以输出该树中最长路径（从一个节点到另一个节点）的长度。在这种情况下，路径的长度是我们从开始到目的地的遍历边数。
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入文件的第一行包含一个整数N ---树中的节点数（0 < N <= 10000）。接下来N -1行包含该树的N -1个边---每行包含一对（u，v），表示在节点u和节点v之间存在边（1 <= u，v <= N）。
输出格式：
一行：输出最长路径的长度。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given an unweighted, undirected tree. Write a program to output the length of the longest path (from one node to another) in that tree. The length of a path in this case is number of edges we traverse from source to destination.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ --- number of nodes in the tree (0 < _N_ <= 10000). Next _N_-1 lines contain _N_-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (_u_, _v_) means there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_ (1 <= _u_, _v_ <= _N_).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Print the length of the longest path on one line.</div>
