<h1>PERMUT1 - Permutations</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在一个有n个元素（1~n）的序列中，**查找这个序列的全排列中一共有多少个排列含有k个逆序对。**
比如当n=4，k=1时，一共有3个排列含有1个逆序对
（友情提示：1243、1324、2134）
### 输入格式:
第一行输入一个d（1<=d<=10),表示一共有d组数据。
对于每组数据，会输入整数n(1<=n<=12) 和整数k(0<=k<=98)
### 输出格式
每行输出每组数据的答案。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Let A = \[a $ _{1} $ ,a $ _{2} $ ,...,a $ _{n} $ \] be a permutation of integers 1,2,...,n. A pair of indices (i,j), 1<=i<=j<=n, is an _inversion_ of the permutation A if a $ _{i} $ >a $ _{j} $ . We are given integers n>0 and k>=0. What is the number of n-element permutations containing exactly k inversions?
For instance, the number of 4-element permutations with exactly 1 inversion equals 3.
### Task
Write a program which for each data set from a sequence of several data sets:
- reads integers n and k from input,
- computes the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions,
- writes the result to output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input file contains one integer d, 1<=d<=10, which is the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set occupies one line of the input file and contains two integers n (1<=n<=12) and k (0<=k<=98) separated by a single space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The i-th line of the output file should contain one integer - the number of n-element permutations with exactly k inversions.</div>
