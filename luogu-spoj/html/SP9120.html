<h1>GCPC11D - Magic Star</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>- 一个六角星包含12个字母A~L，每一个交点或顶点上都有一个字母（见英文题目描述），要求这个六角星的每一条边上的四个字母在字母表中的位置之和相等，且字母没有重复。例如A是1，L是12.现在给出这个六角星若干个点上的字母，请你填出其他字母，使每一条边的和相等且最小。
- 输入一个5行9列的矩阵，未知的字母用 x 表示，用半角句号 . 来保持对齐。
- 输出和输入一样，但是要把 x 的地方填上字母。你可以默认一定会有解。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A magic star consists of all the numbers from _1_ to _12_ arranged in the shape of a hexagram:
![example image](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9120/3d20330b2ff74f8126e5b3ea9c38989226dcbc5a.png)
The magic comes from the fact that in each line of _4_ numbers, the sum of the numbers is _26_. In the example given above, the six lines consist of the following numbers:
- _1 + 4 + 10 + 11_
- _11 + 5 + 3 + 7_
- _7 + 6 + 12 + 1_
- _2 + 10 + 5 + 9_
- _9 + 3 + 6 + 8_
- _8 + 12 + 4 + 2_
There are several possible ways to arrange the numbers to get a magic star. Given a partially labelled star, your task is to extend the solution such that a magic star is formed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of a visualization of the star; the unlabelled fields of the star will be represented by an 'x' character, and labelled fields will contain a letter between 'A' and 'L', where the _i_-th letter in the alphabet represents number _i_. The character '.' is used to align the fields of the star in the shape of a hexagram. You may assume that each input will use the same alignment of the fields as the one in the sample input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the lexicographically smallest extension of the given partial solution which is a magic star (lexicographically smallest means that the concatenation of the rows should result in a string which is lexicographically smaller than other potential solutions). You may assume that there is always a solution for the given input.</div>
