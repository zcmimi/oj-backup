<h1>MAKEMAZE - VALIDATE THE MAZE</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**MAZE MAKING**
There are many algorithms to generate maze. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze\_generation\_algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)). After generating the maze we’ve to validate whether it’s a valid maze or not. A valid maze has exactly one entry point and exactly one exit point (exactly 2 openings in the edges) and there must be atleast one path from the entry point to exit point.

Given a maze, just find whether the maze is "valid" or "invalid".
**Input Specification:**
The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line consists of two integers m and n, the number of rows and columns in the maze. Then contains the description of the matrix M of order mxn. M\[i\]\[j\]=# represents a wall and M\[i\]\[j\]='.' represents a space.
**Output Specification:**
For each test case find whether the maze is "valid" or "invalid".
**Input Constraints:**
1<=t<=10000
1<=m<=20
1<=n<=20

```
