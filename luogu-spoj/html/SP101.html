<h1>FISHER - Fishmonger</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
一个鱼贩想把他的货物从港口运到市场上。在路上，他必须穿越许多小城市。当然，经过每一个城市，他都必须支付通行费。
他必须选择一条路以支付尽可能少的过路费（过路费少优先），同时让他在一定的时间内赶到市场，否则他的鱼就会开始发臭。
输入输出格式
输入格式:
第一行输入n和t。n是城市数，t是限定的时间。后n行，每一行都有n个数字，为每个城市到第i个城市所需的时间。此表以空行结束。通行费表采用相同的格式。
3<=n<=50,t<=1000。所有的数都是整数。
有多组数据输入，用空行分隔。n、t为0时，输入终止。
输出格式:
对于每组数据，输出总通行费以及所需的时间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>![A Fishmonger](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP101/cf5075af23222ff3c18b5e6b426408361091e983.png)A fishmonger wants to bring his goods from the port to the market. On his route he has to traverse an area with many tiny city states. Of course he has to pay a toll at each border.
Because he is a good business man, he wants to choose the route in such a way that he has to pay as little money for tolls as possible. On the other hand, he has to be at the market within a certain time, otherwise his fish start to smell.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the number of states _n_ and available time _t_. The first state is the port, the last state is the market. After this line there are _n_ lines with _n_ numbers each, specifying for each state the travel time to the _i_-th state. This table is terminated with an empty line. The table of the tolls follows in the same format.
_n_ is at least 3 and at most 50. The time available is less than 1000. All numbers are integers.
There are many test cases separated by an empty line. Input terminates with number of states and time equal 0 0.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case your program should print on one line the total amount of tolls followed by the actual travelling time.</div>
