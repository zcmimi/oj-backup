The manufactured mobile phones can be transported to N shops at various locations where these mobile phones are sold. Each shop has a selling capability. ith shop can sell atmost S\[i\] mobile phones in a day. You are given a 2D map of order MxN. ith factory can transport atmost map\[i\]\[j\] mobile phones to jth shop.
Find the maximum number of mobile phones that can be sold by the company on day 1. For simplicity you can assume that the time taken for transportation of raw materials and mobiles as 0.
