<h1>ABCD - Colours A, B, C, D</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>考虑一个具有2行和2N列的表（总共4N个单元格）。 第一行的每个单元由颜色A，B，C，D中的一个着色，使得不存在相同颜色的两个相邻单元。 您必须使用颜色A，B，C，D对第二行进行着色，例如： 表格中的每种颜色（A，B，C和D）都有N个单元格。 没有两个相同颜色的相邻单元格。 （相邻的单元格共享一个垂直或水平的一面。） 这是保证，解决方案，不一定是唯一的，将永远存在。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider a table with 2 rows and 2N columns (a total of 4N cells). Each cell of the first row is coloured by one of the colours A, B, C, D such that there are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. You have to colour the second row using colours A, B, C, D such that:
- There are exactly N cells of each colour (A, B, C and D) in the table.
- There are no two adjacent cells of the same colour. (Adjacent cells share a vertical or a horizontal side.)
It is guaranteed that the solution, not necessarily unique, will always exist.</div>
