<h1>POWERCAR - Car with powers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>![Car with Powers race track](http://www.spoj.com/content/cegprakash:carwithpowers.png "RaceTrack")
The race track is a straight line with starting point at Track\[0\] and ending point at Track\[n-1\]. The car is initially at Track\[0\].
Track\[i\]='#' if the track has a wall at Track\[i\].
The car can move from Track\[i\] to Track\[i+1\] if and only if Track\[i+1\] is not a wall. The time taken to move from Track\[i\] to Track\[i+1\] is 1 unit.
If there is a wall at Track\[i+1\], you can shoot it from Track\[i\] if you have enough bullets in the car. Once a bullet is fired, the bullets count will decrease by 1. The time required to fire a bullet is 0.
It is also allowed to ride the car off the track. It's allowed to move from Track\[i\] to offTrack\[i\], from offTrack\[i\] to offTrack\[i+1\] and from offTrack\[i\] to Track\[i\] (if Track\[i\] is not a wall). The time taken for any of these steps is 2 units.
Find the fastest possible time to finish the race. Print "Impossible" if it's impossible to finish the race.
**Input:**
The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line consists of two integers the length of race track n and the number of bullets the car can fire followed by a line with a string representing the Track.
**Output:**
For each test case, print the expected result as specified in the problem statement.
**Input Constraints:**
1 <= t <= 100
2 <= n <= 1000
0 <= bullets <= 1000
Track\[i\] ∈ {'S','E', '0', '#'}
Track\[0\]='S', Track\[n-1\]='E'
