<h1>SCPC11G - Indomie</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>During recession, Amjad needs to queue for SembakoPlus. Sembako, as we all know, stands for “Sembilan Bahan Pokok” which consists of 9 kinds of item: Rice, Sugar, Cooking-oil, Meat, Egg, Milk, Corn, Kerosene and Iodized Salt. SembakoPlus consists of Sembako and one more item: Indomie! Amjad’s favorite of all time!! (therefore, no wonder why he could stand for this long queue).
Each person in the queue is allowed to pick only one item. No need to ask, Amjad wants only Indomie. Unfortunately, they are running out of SembakoPlus stock and currently there are three kinds of item left: Rice, Sugar and Indomie. As he could see from afar, he is quite sure that Rice and Sugar will be enough for everybody.
Given the number of remaining Indomie and the number of people queuing in front of Amjad, your task is to count the probability that he will get his Indomie. Amjad can’t do programming right now as he is very nervous so he can’t think logically. He needs your help!</div>
