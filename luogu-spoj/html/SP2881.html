<h1>CLONE - Find the Clones</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
Doubleville,德克萨斯州的一个小镇，被外星人攻击了。它们绑架了一些居民，并把他们带到绕地球运行的宇宙飞船上。在一些（非常不令人愉快的）人类实验后，外星人克隆了受害者，并将他们的多个克隆体放回了Doubleville。
所以现在可能发生的是，这里有六个相同的人叫作Hugh F.Bumblebee：原先的人类和他的五个克隆体。
联邦未经授权克隆局The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Cloning （FBUC）委派给你确认有多少克隆体来自每个人的任务。为了在任务中帮助你，FBUC已经收集了每个人的DNA样本。每个来自同一人的克隆体有着相同的DNA序列顺序，并且每个人有着不同的序列顺序（我们知道小镇中没有双胞胎，这不是什么问题）。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
输入包括几个测试用案例。
每个案例开始于一行包括两个整数：人数n（1<=n<=20000），以及DNA序列长度m（1<=m<=20）。
接下来的n行是DNA序列：每行包括一个有m个字符的DNA序列，每个字符都是‘A’，‘C’，‘G’或者‘T’。
输入以一个n=m=0的案例终止。
### 输出格式：
对于每个案例，你需要输出n行，每行包括一个单独的整数。
第一行是不同的没有被克隆的人的数量。第二行是只被克隆一次的人的数量（也就是说，这里有两个相同的序列对每个这样的人）。第三行包括一个数量，对于现在有三个相同序列的人，诸如此类：第i行包括一个数量对于现在有i个相同序列的人。例如，如果这里有11个样本，其中一个来自John Smith，然后其他所有都来自Joe Foobar，然后你需要在第一行和第十行输出‘1’，其他行都是‘0’。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Doubleville, a small town in Texas, was attacked by the aliens. They have abducted some of the residents and taken them to the a spaceship orbiting around earth. After some (quite unpleasant) human experiments, the aliens cloned the victims, and released multiple copies of them back in Doubleville. So now it might happen that there are 6 identical person named Hugh F. Bumblebee: the original person and its 5 copies. The Federal Bureau of Unauthorized Cloning (FBUC) charged you with the task of determining how many copies were made from each person. To help you in your task, FBUC have collected a DNA sample from each person. All copies of the same person have the same DNA sequence, and different people have different sequences (we know that there are no identical twins in the town, this is not an issue).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers: the number 1 <= n <= 20000 people, and the length 1 <= m <= 20 of the DNA sequences. The next n lines contain the DNA sequences: each line contains a sequence of m characters, where each character is either 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'.
The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0 .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you have to output n lines, each line containing a single integer. The first line contains the number of different people that were not copied. The second line contains the number of people that were copied only once (i.e., there are two identical copies for each such person.) The third line contains the number of people that are present in three identical copies, and so on: the i -th line contains the number of persons that are present in i identical copies. For example, if there are 11 samples, one of them is from John Smith, and all the others are from copies of Joe Foobar, then you have to print '1' in the first andthe tenth lines, and '0' in all the other lines.</div>
