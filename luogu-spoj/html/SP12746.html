<h1>CRCLE_UI - Colorful Circle (EASY)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>\------------------------
I take this problem from my midterm exam today, because for me and some of my friends it's interesting, so I decided to translated this problem into english and upload this problem to SPOJ. See the original problem in indonesian language [here](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hDQcB4cjLZQ/UKPlwjMSDeI/AAAAAAAAAPA/ZF-EdjfCKyA/s1600/2012-11-14+23.41.39.jpg "Ori").
\------------------------
Given **N** sectors where 1<**N**<10 $ ^{1000} $ , from a circle that sown in the picture below:
![circle](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xmt-ef5JnZA/UKPNsaeXZZI/AAAAAAAAAOY/n3UcOwaAFY4/s1600/circle.png "circle")
We will color each sector with **K** different colors, where 2<**K**<10 $ ^{1000} $ such that each sector colored with one color and each adjacent sector must have different color. Your task is to count how many ways to color all that sectors.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line, there is a number **T**(0<**T**<1000) denoting number of test cases, then T lines follow.
each line containing two integers: **N** and **K** separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output number of ways to color the circle, since the number can be too large, take modulo 10 $ ^{9} $ +7.</div>
