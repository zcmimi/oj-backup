<h1>ADALIST - Ada and List</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug has a TODO-list (containing only numbers - for simplicity). She is still doing something, so she sometimes erases **k** $ ^{th} $ number, sometimes she inserts something on **k** $ ^{th} $ position and sometime she asks for **k** $ ^{th} $ number.
Sadly, she is now searching for a work at position **k** so she doesn't have time to do this herself. Can you help her?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line will contain **0 < N , the number of elements in TODO-list and number of queries.**
Then a line with **N** numbers follows. Each number **0 means **k** $ ^{th} $ number in her TODO-list.**
Afterward, **Q** lines follow, each beginning with number **1**
1 **k x** means that you will add number **x** to position **k**
2 **k** means that you will erase number from position **k**
3 **k** means that you will print number from position **k**
For all queries, it is true that **1 , **0 (for query **1**, it can be also put to position **\#SizeOfList + 1**)****
You will never get query of type **2** or **3** if the list is empty</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query of type **3**, print **k** $ ^{th} $ numbers</div>
