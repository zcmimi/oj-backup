<h1>HPYNOSII - Happy Numbers II</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题目描述】
能否把一个数通过将其变为其各位平方和，最后得到1？是的话输出需要变的次数，否则输出-1。例子：19->82->68->100->1，输出4。
【输入输出格式】多组数据，第一行为数据组数。对于每组数据，输出答案（一行，一个数）。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The process of “**breaking**” an integer is defined as summing the squares of its digits. For example, the result of breaking the integer **125** is (**1 $ ^{2} $** + **2 $ ^{2} $** + **5 $ ^{2} $** ) = **30**. An integer **N** is **happy** if after “**breaking**” it repeatedly the result reaches 1. If the result never reaches 1 no matter how many times the “**breaking**” is repeated, then N is not a happy number.
### TASK
Write a program that given an integer **T** (number of test cases) and **T** integers, determines for each number whether it is a happy number or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer **T**.
Next 1...T lines contain an integer **N** for detemining whether it is happy or not.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>T lines containing a single integer **N** which is the number of times the process had to be done to determine that N is happy, or **-1** if **N** is not happy.</div>
