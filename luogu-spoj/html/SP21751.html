<h1>DBALLZ - Help the Heroes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Our heroes Vegeta and Goku are fighting against the evil MajinBuu. Goku planned to hit MajinBuu with the spirit-bomb which is a bomb that contains pure energy such that no evil hearted enemy can withstand the impact. Unfortunately Goku needs some time to collect pure energy from all the living things in the universe. So Vegeta is going to distract MajinBuu so that Goku will get his time to concentrate on getting pure energy from the whole universe. Let's call this as the "**Distraction time**".
MajinBuu has this ability to regain its shape once it has been blast into pieces. Vegeta is ready to sacrifice his life by fighting with MajinBuu. You are provided with the total energy of Vegeta, the list of energy blasts that Vegeta can perform in his life time and list of numbers which represents the 'time' to regain MajinBuu's shape corresponding to the energy blast of Vegeta. This list of 'time' is the duration of distraction in which Goku can gather energy from the whole universe. It's better if it's more. Your task is to find out the maximum distraction time.</div>
