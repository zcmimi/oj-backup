<div>## 题目描述
有N个人在一直线上，第i个人的位置为Di，满足Di≤Di+1。最初只有第1个人(在最左边)知道消息。
在任意时刻，每个人可以以每秒1单位的速度向左或向右移动，或者停在原地。如果两个人的距离不超过K，那么就可以进行消息传递。求所有人都知道消息最少需要多少时间。
## 输入
第一行一个正实数K，表示最大的消息传递距离；
第二行一个整数N，表示有N个人；
以下N行，每行一个正实数，表示每个人的位置，第i行表示第i个人的位置Di。
## 输出
输出共一行一个实数，即所有人知道消息的最短时间。（结果保留三位小数点，四舍五入）

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A long straight road connects two villages. Along the road, N messengers are stationed and, when needed, they exchange messages using mostly their legs, but also their vocal cords and ears. The first messenger (the closest to the first village) has a radio-receiver which he uses to keep track of current ongoings in the country. When he finds out who has been evicted from whichever reality show is currently popular, he starts running as fast as he can to share the unfortunate (or fortunate) news with everyone else. While running, he shouts the name of the evicted person so that any fellow messengers that are close enough can hear him. Meanwhile, the remaining messengers do not merely sit and wait, but also run themselves, all with the selfless goal of sharing the news with everyone as fast as possible. The running and shouting proceeds as follows:
- Each of the messengers may run whenever, in either direction, at a speed of at most 1 unit per second, or may decide not to run at all and stand still.
- All messengers that know the news shout it at all times. One messenger can hear another messenger shouting (and learn the news) if the distance between them is at most K units.
Write a program that, given the initial locations of the messengers, determines the least amount of time (in seconds) needed for all messengers to learn the news. The location of every messenger is given with a positive real number – the distance from the first village. As mentioned above, initially only the first messenger knows the news.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 25), the number of test cases. Then for each test case, the first line contains the real number K (0 ≤ K ≤ 1,000,000), the largest distance at which two messengers can hear each other, and the integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000), the number of messengers. Each of the following N lines contains one real number D (0 ≤ D ≤ 1,000,000,000), the distance of one messenger from the first village. The distances will be sorted in ascending order. It is possible for multiple messengers to be at the same location.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a real number, the least time for all messengers to learn the news. Your output needs to be within 0.01 of the official output.</div>
