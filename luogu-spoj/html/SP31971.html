<h1>NEO2 - NEO</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given array with n integer elements. We divide it into several part (may be 1), each part is a consecutive of elements. The **NEO value** in that case is computed by: Sum of value of each **part**. Value of a **part** is sum all elements in this part multiple by its length.
**Example:** We have array: \[ 2 3 -2 1 \]. If we divide it look likes: \[2 3\] \[-2 1\]. Then NEO = (2 + 3) \* 2 + (-2 + 1) \* 2 = 10 - 2 = 8.
Because there are many ways to divide an array into several part, so we can get many of NEO value. Your task is find the NEO with maximum value.</div>
