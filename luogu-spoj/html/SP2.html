<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求给定的两个数之间的素数
Translated by @kaiming</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Peter wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=10). In each of the next t lines there are two numbers m and n (1 <= m <= n <= 1000000000, n-m<=100000) separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n, one number per line, test cases separated by an empty line.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
1 10
3 5</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
