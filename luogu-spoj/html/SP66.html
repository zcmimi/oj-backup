<h1>CRSCNTRY - Cross-country</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Agness是一名计算机科学专业的学生，​​他非常热衷于越野跑，并参加每周六在大公园组织的比赛。每个参与者获得路线卡，该路线卡指定他们需要以给定顺序访问的检查点序列。Agness是一个非常有魅力的女孩，一些男性选手要求她约会。她想在比赛中选择其中一个。因此，她邀请所有她的崇拜者在周六去公园，让比赛决定。获胜者将是获得最高分数的人。艾格尼丝提出了以下规则：
如果跑步者在检查站遇到艾格尼丝，他会得一分
如果跑垒员在检查站得分，那么除非他和Agnes进入他们牌中指定的下一个检查点，否则他无法获得另一分。
卡指定的路线可能不止一次越过同一检查站，
每个参赛者必须严格遵守其卡上的比赛说明。
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入文件的第一行中有一个整数d，1 <= d <= 10.这是数据集的数量。数据集如下。每个数据集由许多行组成，第一行指定Agnes的种族卡中的路线。连续行包含呈现给Tom的卡片上的路线。至少有一条路线呈现给汤姆。该路由作为由单个空格分隔的区间[1,1000]的整数序列给出。数字0代表路径的结尾，但是当它位于行的开头时，它表示数据集的结束。比赛卡中至少有两个，最多2000个检查站。
输出格式：
输出文件的第i行应包含一个整数。该整数应该等于Tom能够在第i个数据集中给出Agnes的种族卡的最大次数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Agness, a student of computer science, is very keen on cross­country running, and she participates in races organised every Saturday in a big park. Each of the participants obtains a route card, which specifies a sequence of checkpoints, which they need to visit in the given order. Agness is a very atractive girl, and a number of male runners have asked her for a date. She would like to choose one of them during the race. Thus she invited all her admirers to the park on Saturday and let the race decide. The winner would be the one, who scores the maximum number of points. Agnes came up with the following rules:
- a runner scores one point if he meets Agnes at the checkpoint,
- if a runner scored a point at the checkpoint, then he cannot get another point unless he and Agnes move to the next checkpoints specified in their cards.
- route specified by the card may cross the same checkpoint more than once,
- each competitor must strictly follow race instructions written on his card.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There is one integer d in the first line of the input file, 1 <= d <= 10. This is the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each data set consists of a number of lines, with the first one specifying the route in Agnes' race card. Consecutive lines contain routes on cards presented to Tom. At least one route is presented to Tom. The route is given as a sequence of integers from interval \[1, 1000\] separated by single spaces. Number 0 stands for the end of the route, though when it is placed at the beginning of the line it means the end of data set. There are at least two and at most 2000 checkpoints in a race card.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The i-th line of the output file should contain one integer. That integer should equal the greatest number of times Tom is able to meet with Agnes for race cards given in the i-th data set.</div>
