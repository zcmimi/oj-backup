<h1>BINGO - Bullshit Bingo</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bullshit Bingo is a game to make lectures, seminars or meetings less boring. Every player has a card with 5 rows and 5 columns. Each of the 25 cells contains a word (the cell in the middle has always the word "BINGO" written in it). Whenever a player hears a word which is written on his card, he can mark it. The cell in the middle is already marked when the game starts. If a player has marked all the words in a row, a column or a diagonal, he stands up and shouts "BULLSHIT". After this, the game starts over again.
Sitting in a lecture, you observe that some students in the audience are playing Bullshit Bingo. You wonder what the average number of different words is until "BULLSHIT" is exclaimed. For the purpose of this problem, a word consists of letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z' or 'A' to 'Z'). Words are separated by characters other than letters (for example spaces, digits or punctuation). Do the comparison of words case-insensitively, i.e. "Bingo" is the same word as "bingo". When counting the number of different words, ignore the word BULLSHIT (indicating the end of the game), and consider only the words of the current game, i.e., if a word has already occurred in a previous game, you may still count it in the current game. If the last game is unfinished, ignore the words of that game.</div>
