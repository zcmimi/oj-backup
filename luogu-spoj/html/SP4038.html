<h1>MREPLBRC - Counting The Way of Bracket Replacement</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MREPLBRC/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MREPLBRC/vn/) A regular bracket sequence is a string of characters consisting only of opening and closing brackets, and satisfying the following conditions:
• An empty string is a regular bracket sequence.
• If A is a regular bracket0sequence, then (A), \[A\] and {A} are also regular bracket sequences.
• If A and B are regular bracket sequences, then AB is also a regular bracket sequence.
For example, the sequences \[({})\], \[\](){} i \[{}\]()\[{}\] are regular, but the sequences \[({{(\[, \[\]({)} and \[{}\])(\[{}\] are not.
Ivica has found a string which looks like it could be a regular bracket sequence. Some of the characters have become smudged and illegible, and could have been any character.
Write a program that calculates how many ways the illegible characters in the string can be replaced by brackets so that the result is a regular bracket sequence. This number can be very large, so output only its last 5 digits.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line contains an even integer N (2 <= N <= 200), the length of the string.
The second line contains the string. Illegible characters are represented by the '?' character.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Output the number of regular bracket sequences the string could have read.</div>
