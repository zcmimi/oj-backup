<h1>ADABASH - Ada and Servers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug has just bought a few servers. She is not a programming bug so she needs a server administrator to set everything for her. Yay, she have chosen you to help her. Your first job is simple - the servers are (somehow) connected with wires and you have to find out the number of components they form.
Easy isn't it? Well sadly the servers are raw and nothing is (can be) installed on them (at the moment), so you can only use **bash**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
