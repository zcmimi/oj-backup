<h1>DOMINO8 - DOMINO</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mirko received an N × N table for his birthday, where a non-negative integer is written in each field
of the table. Unfortunately, the written numbers are too large for Mirko’s taste, so he will place K
dominoes on top of the table that will cover the fields that are too large.
More precisely, Mirko places the dominoes according to the following rules:
• each domino covers two fields of the table that are adjacent in a row or in a column,
• the dominoes do not overlap (but can touch),
• the sum of all visible (uncovered) fields needs to be as small as possible.
It is your task to determine the required minimal sum of visible fields. The test data will be such that
it will always be possible to place K dominoes without overlapping..</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the integers N (1 <= N <= 2000), the dimensions of the table, and K
(1 <= K <= 8), the number of dominoes. Each of the following N lines contains N integers from
the interval \[0, 1000\]. These N × N numbers describe Mirko’s table</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of output must contain the minimal sum of visible fields after covering the
table with dominoes.</div>
