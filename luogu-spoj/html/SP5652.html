<h1>PATULJCI - Snow White and the N dwarfs</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>白雪公主和n个小矮人生活在森林里。当小矮人进入矿井，白雪公主就在网上闲逛。每天早晨，矮人排成长队，吹着口哨向矿井走去。白雪公主在他们周围跑来跑去，拍下照片上传到她最喜欢的社交网站上。当矮人进入矿井时，白雪公主回到他们的房子，翻看照片，挑选漂亮的图片。每个矮人都有一个彩色的帽子。如果超过一半的帽子是相同的颜色，那张图就很漂亮。换句话说，如果图片上有K个小矮人，严格地说如果超过K/2的小矮人有相同的颜色帽子，那就很漂亮了。编写一个程序，检查M张图片，如果他们是漂亮的，输出什么颜色是占主导地位。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Snow White and the N dwarfs live in the forest. While the dwarfs mine away Snow White hangs around social networks.
Each morning the dwarfs form a long line and go whistling away to the mine. Snow White runs around them and snaps pictures to upload onto her favorite social network.
When dwarfs enter the mine, Snow White goes back to their house and goes through the pictures, selecting pretty ones. Each dwarf has a colored cap, and there are C different colors. A picture is pretty if more than half caps on it are of the same color. In other words, if there are K dwarfs on the picture, it is pretty if strictly more than K / 2 dwarfs have same colored caps.
Write a program that will check for a set of M pictures if they are pretty, and what color is dominating if they are.</div>
