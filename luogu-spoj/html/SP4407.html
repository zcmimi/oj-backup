<h1>DAGCNT - Counting Arborescence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>_"In graph theory, an arborescence is a directed graph in which, for a vertex v called the root and any other vertex u, there is exactly one directed path from v to u. In other words, an arborescence is a directed, rooted tree in which all edges point away from the root. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph."_
\-- from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
You are given a directed graph with _N_ vertices, and your task is to count the number of different arborescences of size _N_ that can be found in the given graph.
Two arborescences are considered different when they consist of different edges.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of multiple test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains one integer _N_ described as above.
N lines follows, each consists of _N_ characters, either '0' or '1', representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.
The directed graph contains edge (_i_,_j_) if and only if the _j_th character of the _i_th line of the matrix is '1'.
The graph consists of no more than 8 vertices.
End of input is indicated by a line consisting of a single 0.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line consisting of one single integer, the number of arborescences.</div>
