<h1>POWERPHI - Power of Phi(medium)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Vertu was very impressed by the golden ratio φ=(1+√5)/2 and about it occurring in nature and all that. He now begins to wonder if any non negative integral power of φ is also special. Since he does not like working with decimals, he decided to approximate the positive integral power of φ to its closest integer. Help him by printing the closest integer to φ $ ^{n} $ , given **n**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains **T**, the number of test cases. **T** lines follow, each containing one positive integer **n**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each of these integers, print the closest integer to φ $ ^{n} $ . If you think there are two closest possible integers, print either of them. Print the answer modulo (10 $ ^{9} $ +7).</div>
