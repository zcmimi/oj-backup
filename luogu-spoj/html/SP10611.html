<h1>RRANGE - Ranges</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are N contiguous cells numbered from 1 to N. Initially, each cell contains a 0 in it. A sub-contiguous group of cells can be updated this way:
1\) A range \[i,j\] is defined such that i < j
2\) The cell numbered i is added 1; the cell numbered i + 1 is added 2, and so on until the cell numbered j is reached and added j – i + 1
For example, if N = 7 and the updates \[3, 6\] and \[4,7\] were performed, this is what would happen.
Initially: {0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
Update \[3,6\]: {0,0,1,2,3,4,0}
Update \[4,7\]: {0,0,1,3,5,7,4}
After performing some update operations, it would be amazing to answer questions like the following:
1\) A range \[u,v\] is defined such that u < v
2\) The answer is the sum of every cell in the range \[u,v\] (both u and v are included) modulus 10,000
Given N and U updates ranges. You have to write a program capable of answering Q questions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers: N (1 <= N <= 1,000,000,000), U and Q (1 <= U, Q <= 1,000), representing the number of cells, the number of update operations, and the number of questions respectively.
Each of the following U lines contains two integers i and j (1 <= i < j <= N) separated by a single space indicating an update operation.
Each of the following Q lines contains two integers u and v (1 <= u < v <= N) separated by a single space indicating a question.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each question \[u,v\] you must print the sum of all contiguous cells starting at u and ending at v modulus 10,000.</div>
