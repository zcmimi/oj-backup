<h1>TREEISO - Tree Isomorphism</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two undirected trees T1 and T2 with equal number of vertices N (1
Two trees T1 and T2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection f between the vertex sets of T1 and T2 such that any two vertices u and v of T1 are adjacent in T1 if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in T2.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the number of test cases nTest (1<= nTest <= 400). Each test case contains:
- The first line contains the number of nodes N.
- Each of next N-1 lines contain two integers A, B, denoting that there is an edge in T1 between nodes A and B (1
- Each of next N-1 lines contain two integers A, B, denoting that there is an edge in T2 between nodes A and B (1
The sum of N over all test cases will not exceed 100,000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print YES if T1 and T2 are isomorphic and NO otherwise.</div>
