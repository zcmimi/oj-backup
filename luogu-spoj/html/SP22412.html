<h1>DIVFACT3 - Divisors of factorial (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Factorial numbers are getting big very soon, you'll have to compute the number of divisors of such highly composite numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer _T_, the number of test cases. On the next _T_ lines, you will be given two integers _N_ and _M_.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output _T_ lines, one for each test case, with the number of divisors of the factorial of _N_. Since the answer can get very big, output it modulo _M_.</div>
