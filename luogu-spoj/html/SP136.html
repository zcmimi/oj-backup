<h1>TRANS - Transformation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given two short sequences of numbers, X and Y. Try to determine the minimum number of steps of transformation required to convert sequence X into sequence Y, or determine that such a conversion is impossible.
In every step of transformation of a sequence, you are allowed to replace exactly one occerunce of one of its elements by a sequence of 2 or 3 numbers inserted in its place, according to a rule specified in the input file.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line of input contains four integers - N, M, U, V (1<=N,M<=50). The next two lines of input contain sequences X and Y, consisting of N and M integers respectively. The next U lines contain three integers: _a b c_ each, signifying that integer _a_ can be converted to the sequence _b c_ in one step of transformation. The next V-U lines contain four integers: _a b c d_ each, signifying that integer _a_ can be converted to the sequence _b c d_ in one step of transformation. With the exception of N and M, all integers provided at input are positive and do not exceed 30.
The format of one set of input data is illustrated below.

<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output -1 if it is impossible to convert sequence X into sequence Y, or the minimum number of steps required to achieve this conversion otherwise.</div>
