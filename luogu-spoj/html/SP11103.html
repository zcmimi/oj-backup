<h1>MAIN12B - PrimeFactorofLCM</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Everyone loves Swampy. Swampy the Alligator lives under the city and yearns for a more human like existence. One day Swampy took part in a maths contest to show his supremacy over other his other alligator friends. The task required him to output the prime divisors of the lcm of n numbers a1,a2,..,an. Tired trying the problem, he turned to you for help. He believes that you can help him solve the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single integer n. Next line contains n integers(space separated), a1,a2,..,an.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print Case #X: M where M is the number of prime divisors of lcm(a1,a2,..,an) and then M lines with the prime divisors in non-decreasing order.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1
