<h1>HACKRNDM - Hacking the random number generator</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You recently wrote a random number generator code for a web application and now you notice that some cracker has cracked it. It now gives numbers at a difference of some given value k more predominantly. You being a hacker decide to write a code that will take in n numbers as input and a value k and find the total number of pairs of numbers whose absolute difference is equal to k, in order to assist you in your random number generator testing.
NOTE: All values fit in the range of a signed integer, n, k>=1</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>1st line contains n & k.
2nd line contains n numbers of the set. All the n numbers are assured to be distinct.
(**Edited:** n <= 10^5)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>One integer saying the no of pairs of numbers that have a diff k.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5 2\n1 5 3 4 2</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
