<h1>MATCHING - Fast Maximum Matching</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>FJ has N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) cows and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 50,000) bulls. Given a list of P (1 ≤ P ≤ 150,000) potential matches between a cow and a bull, compute the greatest number of pairs that can be matched. Of course, a cow can be matched to at most one bull, and vice versa.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains three integers, N, M, and P. Each of the next P lines contains two integers A (1 ≤ A ≤ N) and B (1 ≤ B ≤ M), denoting that cow A can be matched with bull B.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer that is the maximum number of pairs that can be obtained.</div>
