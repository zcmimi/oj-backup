<h1>SNOWGAME - Snowball Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意简述：
有N个雪球和一架天平，而N个球中有一个较重的球。求在每个雪球最多允许被称K次的情况下，保证找到较重的雪球的最少次数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Farmer John's N (1 <= N <= 10 $ ^{18} $ ) cows went for a trip around the world. Now they are at the North Pole. They decided to play a snowball game. Each of the cows made one snowball. As it is known, heavier snowballs make more harm. FJ is sure that cows' snowballs are of the same weight except one snowball, which is heavier. FJ has one balance scale. With it he can know which of two snowball groups is heavier. Snowballs get damaged when weighed, so each snowball can take part in a weighing at most K (1 <= K <= 10000) times. Help FJ find the minimal number of weighings after which he can find the heaviest snowball.</div>
