<h1>PLD - Palindromes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：给定一个整数k（2≤k≤30000）和一个字符串s（|s|<30000且都是小写字母），求有多少个起始点不同的长度为k的回文串。
输入格式：第一行整数k，第二行字符串s。
输出格式：一行，即答案ans。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> A palindrome is a word, phrase, number or other sequence of units that has the property of reading the same in either direction, e.g. 'racecar', 'solos'.
### Task
You are given a number k (2≤k≤30000) and a non-empty string S whose length does not exceed 30000 lowercase letters.
We say two palindromes are different when they start from different positions. How many different palindromes of the length k does S contains?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains K. The second line contains S. K does not exceed the length of S.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first and only line should consist of a single number - the number of palindromes found.</div>
