<h1>TWOSQRS - Two squares or not two squares</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
给出多个正整数，判断每个数能否表示为两个整数的平方的和
输入格式：
第一行：一个正整数c,表示需要判断的数的个数(c<=100)
之后c行每行一个正整数n，表示需要判断的数(0<=n=<10^12)
输出格式：
对于每一个n，判断能否写成两个整数的平方的和的形式；如果能，输出“Yes”，如果不能，则输出“No”
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Given integer n decide if it is possible to represent it as a sum of two squares of integers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> First line of input contains one integer c <= 100 - number of test cases. Then c lines follow, each of them consisting of exactly one integer 0 <= n <= 10^12.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case output Yes if it is possible to represent given number as a sum of two squares and No if it is not possible.</div>
