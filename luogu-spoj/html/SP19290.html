<h1>WPC5F - Parade</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is the Annual Parade of the Galactical Wars. Great men and women from around the cosmos have come to view this spectacular event. To make this a special occasion, the leaders in galaxy H2 have decided to arrange his participants in a particularly beautiful order.
Firstly, they have chosen n particularly suited participants. These n participants have distinct heights ranging from 1 to n. They have arranged them in some way, so that the height of the ith student is H(i).
The sworn enemies of H2, galaxy H3 have obtained some secret information on this arrangement. They know that there is a set of elements A(containing total k indices), such that H(j) < H(j-1) **IF AND ONLY IF** j belongs to A. As a Martian on H3, your organizer asks you to find the number of such possible configurations that H2 could have made.
