<h1>BINSTIRL - Binary Stirling Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定$n,m$，求$S(n,m)\%2$
$S$为第二类斯特林数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> The Stirling number of the second kind S(n, m) stands for the number of ways to partition a set of n things into m nonempty subsets. For example, there are seven ways to split a four-element set into two parts: {1, 2, 3} u {4}, {1, 2, 4} u {3}, {1, 3, 4} u {2}, {2, 3, 4} u {1}, {1, 2} u {3, 4}, {1, 3} u {2, 4}, {1, 4} u {2, 3}.
There is a recurrence which allows you to compute S(n, m) for all m and n.
S(0, 0) = 1,
S(n, 0) = 0, for n > 0,
S(0, m) = 0, for m > 0,
S(n, m) = m\*S(n-1, m) + S(n-1, m-1), for n, m > 0.
Your task is much "easier". Given integers n and m satisfying 1 <= m <= n, compute the parity of S(n, m), i.e. S(n, m) mod 2.
For instance, S(4, 2) mod 2 = 1.
### Task
Write a program that:
- reads two positive integers n and m,
- computes S(n, m) mod 2,
- writes the result.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to the number of data sets, 1 <= d <= 200. The data sets follow.
Line i + 1 contains the i-th data set - exactly two integers n $ _{i} $ and m $ _{i} $ separated by a single space, 1 < = m $ _{i} $ < = n $ _{i} $ <= 10 $ ^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set. Line i, 1 <= i < = d, should contain 0 or 1, the value of S(n $ _{i} $ , m $ _{i} $ ) mod 2.</div>
