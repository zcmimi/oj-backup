<h1>DCEPC12H - Height of Expectation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>欢迎来到ICPC !ICPC是一个编程比赛，每年有N个团队参加。在N支队伍中，我们学院选出了K支队伍，K总是一个质数。在进入ICPC之前，我们想计算一下我们学校的预期总成绩，预期总成绩定义为学院团队排名的预期中值。所有的队伍都是不同的，团队的排名值总是在1到N之间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Welcome To ICPC! ICPC is a programming competition in which N teams participate every year. Out of N teams, K number of teams has been selected from our college. You know what? K is always a prime number. Coincidence! Before going to ICPC, we want to calculate our expected overall score of our college.
Expected Overall score is defined as expected median value of our college team’s ranks.
All the ranks are distinct. Team’s rank value always lies between 1 to N.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line consists of T, the number of test cases.
Each of the next T lines contains 2 space separated integers N and K.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output T lines each line containing expected overall score of our college. You should output at least 6 digits after decimal.</div>
