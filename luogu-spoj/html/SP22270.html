<h1>PERIOD2 - Periodic function, trip 2</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Milankovitch's cycle theory is an example with cumulative effect of several periodic functions. We can study past climatic patterns on Earth through orbital forcing.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer _T_, the number of test cases. On the next _T_ lines, you will be given two integers _N_ and _M_. Consider the family of any finite sum of ( _n_-periodic functions with _n_ in \[1.._N_\] ). All those functions share a common smallest period.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Print the smallest common period of that family. As the answer can get very big, simply output it modulo _M_.</div>
