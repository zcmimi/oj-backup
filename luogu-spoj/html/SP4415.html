<h1>INTEGER1 - Power of Integer</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>对于一个正整数y，总有正整数x和z使得x^k=y，我们把k能取到的最大值记作y的power
有多组数据，每组输入a和b，要求输出从a到b每一个数的power之和</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For a given positive integer _y_(_y_ > 1), if we can find a largest integer k and a smallest positive integer _x_, such that _x^k=y_, then the power of _y_ is regarded as _k_.
Calculate the sum of the power of the integers from a to b. (2<= _a_ <= _b_ <=10 $ ^{18} $ )</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of multiple test cases.
For each test case, there is one line containing two integers _a_ and _b_.
End of input is indicated by a line containing two zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output the sum of the power of the integers from _a_ to _b_.</div>
