<h1>QCJ3 - The Game</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>汤姆和汉克斯玩下面的游戏。游戏板上有一排方块，标的是0，1，2……一定数量的硬币被放置在一个方块上，可能有一个以上的硬币。在每个回合中，玩家可以将一枚硬币精确地移动到任意一个正方形的左边，如果玩家希望从正方形I中取出一枚硬币，他可以将它放置在属于集合的任意一个正方形（0,1,…I-1）。游戏结束时，所有的硬币都在Square 0和玩家谁使最后一步获胜。
第一行将包含n个测试用例的数目，然后接着是2n行。对于每个测试用例，第一行有“板”的大小，下一行有“整数”。这是我的第一次
元素钍的符号
整数给出第I^{th}中的硬币数
元素钍的符号
正方形（从1开始）.其中至少有一个整数是不零的。输入的所有数字将小于25
对于每个测试用例，输出一行，其中包含“汤姆胜”或“汉克斯胜”。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tom and Hanks play the following game. On a game board having a line of squares labelled from 0,1,2 ... certain number of coins are placed with possibly more than one coin on a single square. In each turn a player can move exactly one coin to any square to the left i.e, if a player wishes to remove a coin from square i, he can then place it in any square which belongs to the set (0,1, ... i-1) . The game ends when all coins are on square 0 and player that makes the last move wins. Given the description of the squares and also assuming that Tom always makes the first move you have tell who wins the game (Assuming Both play Optimally).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line will contain N the number of test cases and then 2N lines follow. For each test case the first line will have S the size of the board and in the next line S integers follow. The i $ ^{th} $ integer gives the the number of coins in the i $ ^{th} $ square (starting from 1) . Atleast one of the S integers will be non zero. All the numbers in the input will be less than 25.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output one line containing either "Tom Wins" or "Hanks Wins".</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
