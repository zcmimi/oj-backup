<h1>GEEKOUNT - EVEN COUNT</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Problem Statement:**
Let f(x) be the product of digits of a number.
Given L and R, find the number of values of 'i' such that L <= i <= R and f(i) is [even](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number).
**Input:**
The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, you are given the two integers L and R.
**Output:**
For each test case, print the number of values of 'i' such that L <= i <= R and f(i) is even.
**Input Constraints:**
1 <= t <= 100
1 <= L <= R <= 1000000000
**Sample Input:**
2
2 12
4 23
**Sample Output:**
