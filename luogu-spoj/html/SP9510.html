<h1>ADSPROP - Ads Proposal</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are **N** customers set their **M** different advertisements on Baidu. Each advertisement is owned by single customer. The ads system of Baidu records the number of clicks of each advertisement this year. The proposal system wants to analysis the advertisements about the relativity of the description length and the number of clicks of the advertisements. During the analysis, it is very important to do such a query to ask the total length of the advertisements with top **K** clicking times for each customer. You may assume the clicks of all advertisements are distinct.
Your task is to help Baidu to design this little toolkit.</div>
