<h1>MMIND - The Game of Master-Mind</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【题面】
如果你想买一部新手机，当然有许多不同的类型和型号可供选择。要决定哪一个最适合你，你必须考虑几个重要的参数:它的大小和重量，电池容量，WAP支持，颜色，价格等等。最重要的东西之一是手机所提供的游戏列表。诺基亚是全世界最成功的手机制造商之一，因为它有著名的贪吃蛇和贪吃蛇2。ACM想生产和销售自己的手机，但他们需要为它开发几个手游。其中一个就是著名的密码破译棋盘游戏“珠玑妙算（Mastermind)”。 比赛在两个选手之间进行。其中一个选择由P个由数字组成的密码，数字的最大上限为C。第二个玩家的目标是猜测出数字的秘密序列。有些数字可能不会出现在密码中，有些数字可能会出现多次。 玩家进行猜测，猜测的方式与密码相同。在每次猜测之后，向他/她提供关于猜测成功程度的信息。这种反馈称为提示。每个提示由B个黑球和W个白球组成。如果用户输入的数字中，某个数字的位置和大小都正确，那么就算一个黑球；如果数字正确位置不正确，算一个白球。例如，如果密码是“白色、黄色、红色、蓝色、白色”，并且猜测是“白色、红色、白色、白色、蓝色”，则提示将包括一个黑球(对于第一个位置上的白色)和三个白球(对于其他白色、红色和蓝色)。目标是用最少的提示猜测序列。 新的ACM手机应该有可能扮演这两个角色。它可以制作密码并给出提示，但也可以自己猜测。你的目标是为后一种情况编写一个程序，也就是说一个能让主脑猜测的程序。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> If you want to buy a new cellular phone, there are many various types to choose from. To decide which one is the best for you, you have to consider several important things: its size and weight, battery capacity, WAP support, colour, price. One of the most important things is also the list of games the phone provides. Nokia is one of the most successful phone makers because of its famous Snake and Snake II. ACM wants to make and sell its own phone and they need to program several games for it. One of them is Master-Mind, the famous board logical game.
The game is played between two players. One of them chooses a _secret code_ consisting of P ordered pins, each of them having one of the predefined set of C colours. The goal of the second player is to guess that secret sequence of colours. Some colours may not appear in the code, some colours may appear more than once.
The player makes guesses, which are formed in the same way as the secret code. After each guess, he/she is provided with an information on how successful the guess was. This feedback is called a _hint_. Each hint consists of B black points and W white points. The black point stands for every pin that was guessed right, i.e. the right colour was put on the right position. The white point means right colour but on the wrong position. For example, if the secret code is "white, yellow, red, blue, white" and the guess was "white, red, white, white, blue", the hint would consist of one black point (for the white on the first position) and three white points (for the other white, red and blue colours). The goal is to guess the sequence with the minimal number of hints.
The new ACM phone should have the possibility to play both roles. It can make the secret code and give hints, but it can also make its own guesses. Your goal is to write a program for the latter case, that means a program that makes Master-Mind guesses.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case describes one game situation and you are to make a guess. On the first line of each test case, there are three integer numbers, P, C and M. P ( 1 <= P <= 10) is the number of pins, C (1 <= C <= 100) is the number of colours, and M (1 <= M <= 100) is the number of already played guesses.
Then there are 2 x M lines, two lines for every guess. At the first line of each guess, there are P integer numbers representing colours of the guess. Each colour is represented by a number G $ _{i} $ , 1 <= G $ _{i} $ <= C. The second line contains two integer numbers, B and W, stating for the number of black and white points given by the corresponding hint.
Let's have a secret code S $ _{1} $ , S $ _{2} $ , ... S $ _{P} $ and the guess G $ _{1} $ , G $ _{2} $ , ... G $ _{P} $ . Then we can make a set H containing pairs of numbers (I,J) such that S $ _{I} $ = G $ _{J} $ , and that any number can appear at most once on the first position and at most once on the second position. That means for every two different pairs from that set, (I $ _{1} $ ,J $ _{1} $ ) and (I $ _{2} $ ,J $ _{2} $ ), we have I $ _{1} $ <> I $ _{2} $ and J $ _{1} $ <> J $ _{2} $ . Then we denote B(H) the number of pairs in the set, that meet the condition I = J, and W(H) the number of pairs with I <> J.
We define an ordering of every two possible sets H $ _{1} $ and H $ _{2} $ . Let's say H $ _{1} $ <= H $ _{2} $ if and only if one of the following holds:
- B(H $ _{1} $ ) < B(H $ _{2} $ ), or
- B(H $ _{1} $ ) = B(H $ _{2} $ ) and W(H $ _{1} $ ) <= W(H $ _{2} $ )
Then we can find a maximal set H $ _{max} $ according to this ordering. The numbers B(H $ _{max} $ ) and W(H $ _{max} $ ) are the black and white points for that hint.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every test case, print the line containing P numbers representing P colours of the next guess. Your guess must be valid according to all previous guesses and hints. The guess is valid if the sequence could be a secret code, i.e. the sequence was not eliminated by previous guesses and hints.
If there is no valid guess possible, output the sentence You are cheating!. If there are more valid guesses, output the one that is lexicographically smallest. I.e. find such guess G that for every other valid guess V there exists such a number I that:
- G $ _{J} $ = V $ _{J} $ for every J<I, and - G $ _{I} $ <V $ _{I} $ .</div>
