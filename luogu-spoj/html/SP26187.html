<h1>CLAW - Captain Claw</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Captain Claw is at the bank of a river of acid and he needs to cross it. Thr river is x metres wide but Captain Claw can jump at most d metres.
However, the Captain can jump only on stones which keep appearing in the stream.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are multiple test cases. For each test case.
The first line contains n,x and d.
The next n lines denotes subsequent seconds.
For each line, the first integer, c, denotes the number of number of stones appearing in this second.
Then c integers follow.
The ith integer means that a stone would appears at the position of that integer.
Find the minimum time needed by the Captain to cross the river.
1 <= t <= 30
1 <= x <= 10^5
1 <= d <= x
1 <= n <= 10^3
1 <= sum(c) <= 10^5</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single integer in each line - the time taken to cross the river.
Output -1 if its not possible to cross the river in n seconds.</div>
