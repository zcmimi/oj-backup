<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A Program which has the following format:
```
<Program>::=<sentence><line break>{<sentence><line break>}
<setence>::=<level><space><body>
<body>::=<addition> | <output> | <goto> | <condition> | <end>
<addition>::=<variable>+<integer>
<output>::=<variable>?
<goto>::=GO<space><level>
<condition>::=IF<space><variable>=<integer><space><goto>
<end>::=END
<variable>::=<character>
<level>::=<integer>
<integer>::=<digit>{<digit>}
<character>::=A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z
<digit>::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
<line break>::=(ASCII 10)
<space>::=(ASCII 32)
```
The program runs following the following rules:
- Program starts from the sentence whose level is minimum, and executed by the level from low to high except that the sentence is<goto>or<condition>.
- All variables are initialized to 0.
- <Addition>means<variable>+=<integer>in C++.
- <output>means write the value of<variable>to the output file(we aren't interesting about the real output file.)
- <condition>means if and only if the value of the <variable> equals to <integer>, <goto> will be executed, otherwise the next sentence executed is as usual.
- After<goto>, the next sentence executed is the sentence with level which equals to the level in<goto>.
- Program terminates by itself when <end> is executed.
- The numbers during the program is running will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
- The number of sentences in the program is not more than 100.
- The length of each line in the input file is not more than 20.
- The input is correct.
- The sentence with the maximum level is always <end>.
- Any level is not more than 3000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
