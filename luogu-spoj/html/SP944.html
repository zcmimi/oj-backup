<h1>FTOUR - Free Tour</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>
为了庆祝Travel Agent（旅行社） SPOJ(安全-专业-热情-快乐（的服务？口号？）)两周年纪念日，管理团队打算为用户们举办免费去 周围城市旅行的活动，使他们对SPOJ更加满意
这个旅行是一个简单的圆圈线路（回路），从任意一个城市(被叫做起点城市（源点）)开始去参观其他城市（每个城市最多 可以被参观一次），然后返回起点城市。这个旅行中的道路的数量是偶数（因为我们在庆祝2（偶数）周年纪念日）， 因为国内不同区域已经计划了许多旅游计划，所以组织这次活动的可能成本会非常高。因此，SPOJ的管理团队希望 找出至少一条合理的旅游方案，使得途径的路径尽可能少。
我们给了你SPOJ举行免费旅行活动的一些地图，对于每张地图，帮助他们找出最佳的合理的旅行方案。
输入解释：第一行一个整数t表示数据组数，每组数据第一行有两个整数n，m，表示点数，边数，下面m行 每行两个整数a，b，表示a，b之间有一条边 输出格式：每组数据没有满足条件的就输出-1，否则输出一个整数n表示道路数量，然后下一行n个整数表示从源点开始走途径的点最后又回到 源点的路径。（源点，途径的点......，源点）

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> In order to celebrate the 2nd anniversary of Travel Agent SPOJ (Safe – Professional – hOspitable – Joyful), the management intend to hold free tours around cities for clients to make them more satisfied with SPOJ.
A tour is a simple cycle, starting at any city (called a source-city) visits some other cities (each city must be visited at most once) and then returns to the source-city. The number of roads in the tour should be an even number because we are celebrating a 2nd anniversary, and 2 is even! Since many tours in different areas of the country are planned, the cost of organising them could turn out quite high. Hence, the management of SPOJ hope to find at least one 'reasonable' tour, which should have as small a number of roads as possible.
You're given maps of the areas where SPOJ wants to hold free tours. For each map, help them figure out a reasonable tour.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input contains an integer **t**, the number of maps (**t** <= 5). **t** maps follow.
For each map:
- In the first line there are 2 integers **N** – number of cities in that area, **M** – number of roads (1 <= **N** <= 8000, 0 <= **M** <= 10000)
- In the next **M** lines, the i-th line describes the i-th road: a line with two integers **a b** denotes a bidirectional road between city **a** and city **b**
There is one blank line between successive tests.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each map, if there is no tour satisfying the conditions, write "-1" (without quotes). Otherwise, write one integer representing the number of roads in a reasonable tour, and in the next line show out the tour with form "source-city a b c .. source-city", that means the tour is source-city -> city a -> city b -> … -> source-city. If there are many tours satisfy in each map, any of them will be accepted.</div>
