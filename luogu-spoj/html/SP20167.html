Array with Hudai Calculation
You will be given an array A with N integers A[1…N]. You will also be given two integers P and K. You need to find a value X [ X can be any value from array A] for which this function will be maximized:
 
Here ABS means Absolute Value. For example: ABS(-1) is 1, also ABS(1) means 1.
Here MOD means Modulo Operation.  W MOD Y will give you the remainder after dividing W by Y.And X is any value from the array A.
But we don’t have interest in X, as there will be several X for which the value will be maximized. So we just want the maximum value. Can you find it for us as you are a great programmer on SPOJ ?
