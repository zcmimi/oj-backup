<h1>TETRAHED - Point in tetrahedron</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There're given 5 points in 3D coordinates (integers 0<=x,y,z<100). Their order is arbitrary. 4 of them are the vertices of a tetrahedron whose edges can be of different size. One is lying in this tetrahedron. Find its index (1-5) in the array of points.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line the number T (T<1000) of test cases.
Then for each test case 5 lines with the space separated x-, y- and z-coordinates of the 5 points.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case a line with the index of that point which is lying in the tetrahedron formed of the 4 other points.</div>
