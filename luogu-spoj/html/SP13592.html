<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>MathJax.Hub.Config({
tex2jax: {
inlineMath: [['$','$'], ['\\(','\\)']],
skipTags: ["script","noscript","style","textarea","code"]
}
});
Alice has a problem. She loves Bob but is unable to face up to him. So she decides to send a letter to Bob expressing her feelings. She wants to send it from her computer to Bob's computer through the internet.
The internet consists of $N$ computers, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Alice's computer has the number $1$ and Bob's computer has the number $N$.
Due to some faulty coding, the computers start behaving in unexpected ways. On recieving the file, computer $i$ will forward it to computer $j$ with probability $P\_{ij}$. The time taken to transfer the file from computer $i$ to computer $j$ is $T\_{ij}$.
Find the expected time before Bob finds out about Alice's undying love for him.
**Note:** Once the letter is recieved by Bob's computer, his computer will just deliver it to Bob and stop forwarding it.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains $T$, the total test cases.
Each test case looks as follows:
First line contains $N$, the total number of computers in the network.
The next $N$ lines contain $N$ numbers each. The $j$'th number on the $i$'th line is the value $P\_{ij}$ in percents.
The next $N$ lines contain $N$ numbers each. The $j$'th number on the $i$'th line is the value $T\_{ij}$.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single line with a real number - The expected time of the transfer.
Your output will be considered correct if each number has an absolute or relative error less than $10^{-6}$.</div>
