<h1>DISTANCE - Manhattan</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The L $ _{1} $ distance of two d-dimensional points is the sum of absolute values of their coordinate differences (i.e. Σ $ _{i=1} $ $ ^{d} $ |x $ _{i} $ - y $ _{i} $ | for two points x,y). Given N points in the plane you must find the farthest pair of points under the L $ _{1} $ distance metric and output their distance.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input is "N d" (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ d ≤ 6) signifying that there are N points in d-dimensional space. N lines then follow, where the ith line is a space-separated list of d numbers, the coordinates of the ith point. All given coordinates are integers that are at most 1000000 in absolute value, and all given points are distinct.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your output should consist of a single integer, the farthest distance between a pair of input points, followed by a newline.</div>
