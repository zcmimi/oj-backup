<h1>KALTSUM - k Alternating Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sameen has:
1. An array having N integers
2. Q friends
His friends are curious about the array. So, each of his friends asks Sameen a question about the array. Every question is described by 3 integers: i, j and k. In reply to a question, Sameen has to say the “k alternating sum” of the subarray starting at position i and ending at position j \[1 based indexing\]
“k alternating sum” of a subarray starting at position i and ending at position j can be calculated in the following way:
Add the first k numbers\[starting from position i\]
Subtract the second k numbers\[starting from position i+k\]
Add the third k numbers\[starting from position i+2\*k\]
Subtract the fourth k numbers\[starting from position i+3\*k\]
And so on till adding/subtracting the j-th number…
(j-i+1) will be divisible by k.
\[See sample Input/output and explanation section for more details\]
Can you help Sameen in answering the questions?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two integers N and Q. The next line contains N integers, the numbers in the array. Then each of the following Q lines contains 3 integers i, j & k.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query output an integer in a separate line, the answer for that query. Queries should be answered in the order given in the input.
**Constraints:**
1 k 100000
1 N 100000
1 Q 100000
-1000000000 Value of a number in the array 1000000000
**(j-i+1) will be divisible by k.**</div>
