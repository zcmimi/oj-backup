<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Christy C. Coder正前往滑铁卢参加编程比赛。在途中，她在多伦多停留观光。关于旅行的不幸之处在于，每个回家的人都希望她带回一切照片。克里斯蒂讨厌拍照：这让她看起来像个游客！幸运的是，克里斯蒂有一个让她拍照的计划非常轻松。
加拿大国家电视塔高553米，是世界上最高的独立式建筑。塔楼上方351米是“360”旋转餐厅，每72分钟旋转360度。从那里，克里斯蒂可以看到整个城市，并使用她的新型100倍光学变焦相机拍摄所有地标的特写照片。由于餐厅本身旋转，她只需站在一个地方就可以向各个方向拍照。
电梯通常需要61秒才能从地面到旋转餐厅。不幸的是，当克里斯蒂到达加拿大国家电视塔时，她得知电梯已经停止服务，所以她必须走楼梯，这需要更长的时间。克里斯蒂在晚上9点36分到达顶峰，此时天黑了。她只能用非常强大的闪光灯拍照，这需要很长时间才能在照片之间充电。闪光灯正在充电时，她无法拍摄任何照片。因此，克里斯蒂需要一个新的程序来计算她必须在餐厅花费的最短时间，以使其旋转到足以带来所有地标，并考虑到闪光灯的充电时间。除了这些困难，餐厅在午夜关闭。从而，
和以前一样，假设克里斯蒂在选择初始位置后不会在餐厅里四处走动，而是等待它旋转到拍摄每张照片所需的角度。和白天的问题（CNEASY）一样，克里斯蒂可以（很快）选择她的初始职位，因为餐厅不是那么大。Christy总是指出她的相机完全垂直于窗户，以尽量减少玻璃引起的失真。拍完最后一张照片后，克里斯蒂必须留在餐厅，直到她的闪光充电。由于外面是黑暗的，如果不止一个地标占据角度位置，克里斯蒂每张照片只能捕获一个地标（为了保持所需的地标在焦点上，模糊所有其他地标）。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Christy C. Coder is traveling to Waterloo for a programming competition. On the way, she stops in Toronto to do some sightseeing. The unfortunate thing about travelling is that everyone back home expects her to bring back pictures of everything. Christy hates taking pictures: it makes her look like such a tourist! Fortunately, Christy has a plan to make her picture-taking quite painless.
At 553 m tall, CN Tower is the world's tallest free-standing building. 351 m up the tower is the "360" rotating restaurant, which rotates a full 360 degrees every 72 minutes. From there, Christy can see the whole city, and take close-up pictures of all the landmarks using her fancy new 100x optical zoom camera. Since the restaurant itself rotates, she only needs to stand in one place to take pictures in all directions.
The elevator normally takes 61 seconds to get from the ground up to the rotating restaurant. Unfortunately, when Christy arrives at the CN Tower, she learns that the elevator is out of service, so she has to take the stairs, which takes somewhat longer. Christy arrives at the top at 9:36 pm, by which time it is dark. She can only take pictures with a very powerful flash, which takes a long time to recharge between pictures. While the flash is charging, she cannot take any pictures. Thus, Christy needs a new program to calculate the minimum time that she must spend in the restaurant in order for it to rotate enough to bring all the landmarks in view, and taking into consideration the charging time of the flash. In addition to these difficulties, the restaurant closes at midnight. Thus, Christy may not have enough time to take pictures of all the landmarks.
As before, assume that Christy does not move around in the restaurant after choosing her initial position, but waits for it to rotate to the angle required to take each picture. As with the daytime problem (CNEASY), Christy can (very quickly) pick her initial position, since the restaurant is not that big. Christy always points her camera exactly perpendicular to the window to minimize distortion due to the glass. After taking the last picture, Christy must stay in the restaurant until her flash recharges. Since it is dark outside, if more than one landmark occupies an angular position, Christy can capture **only one one landmark per photo** (in order to keep the desired landmark in focus, blurring all others).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input consists of the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line is an integer _n_ (1 n n lines specify a landmark. Each landmark specification consists of the landmark name (a string of uppercase and lowercase letters), a space, and the compass angle, in degrees (specified with a maximum of 2 decimal places), to the landmark from the CN Tower (0 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south, 270 = west). Finally, the last line contains the amount of time, in seconds, required for the flash to charge.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single integer, the minimum number of seconds that Christy must remain in the restaurant. If the time is not an integer number of seconds, round it up to the nearest second. If it is not possible for Christy to take all the pictures before closing, instead output "not possible".</div>
