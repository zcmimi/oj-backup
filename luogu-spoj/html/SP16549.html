<h1>QTREE6 - Query on a tree VI</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
给你一棵n个点的树，编号1~n。每个点可以是黑色，可以是白色。初始时所有点都是黑色。下面有两种操作请你操作给我们看：
0 u：询问有多少个节点v满足路径u到v上所有节点（包括）都拥有相同的颜色
1 u：翻转u的颜色
输入格式
一行一个整数n
接下来n-1行，每行两个整数表示一条边
接下来一行一个整数m表示操作次数
接下来m行，每行两个整数分别表示操作类型和被操作节点
输出格式
对每个询问操作输出相应的结果
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with **n** nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to **n**. Each node has a color, white or black. All the nodes are black initially. We will ask you to perform some instructions of the following form:
- **0 u**: ask for how many nodes are connected to **u**, two nodes are connected if all the node on the path from **u** to **v** (inclusive **u** and **v**) have the same color.
- **1 u**: toggle the color of **u** (that is, from black to white, or from white to black).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a number **n** that denotes the number of nodes in the tree (1 n n-1 lines, there will be two numbers (**u**, **v**) that describes an edge of the tree (1 u, **v** n). The next line contains a number **m** denoting number of operations we are going to process (1 m m lines describe an operation (**t**, **u**) as we mentioned above(0 t u n).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query operation, output the corresponding result.</div>
