<h1>KUTH - Kutevi Hard</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One day Mirko was cleaning up his room and found a straightedge and a compass. He went to the school the next day and challenged his friend Slavko to a geometric construction battle. Mirko knows how to construct some angles using the straightedge and compass and knows how to subtract and add any two angels he constructs. Slavko now shouts random angles and Mirko must draw them as fast as possible. You are observing this battle and would like to know if Mirko can construct the angles Slavko shouts at all.</div>
