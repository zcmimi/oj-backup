<h1>MTRIAREA - Maximum Triangle Area</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/MTRIAREA/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MTRIAREA/vn/)Given n distinct points on a plane, your task is to ﬁnd the triangle that have the maximum area, whose vertices are from the given points.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of several test cases. The ﬁrst line of each test case contains an integer n, indicating the number of points on the plane. Each of the following n lines contains two integer xi and yi, indicating the ith points. The last line of the input is an integer −1, indicating the end of input, which should not be processed. You may assume that 1
