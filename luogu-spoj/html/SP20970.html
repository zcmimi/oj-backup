<h1>HDEVIL - Alia and Handsome Devil</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Alia has been assigned a homework by her maths teacher to find the "Handsome" numbers. She is confused about these numbers, as we all know that she is very "intelligent" :P
So she needs your help. Following is an exact line that her teacher has given about Handsome numbers : "Handsome number can be defined as a number such that sum of all the proper divisors of handsome number with modulus to m, has to be a devil number. This Devil number is a number whose total number of proper divisors , is a Fibonacci number (0,1,1,2,3,5....)."
Note : Alia's lucky number is 1, so she assumes 1 as a proper divisor always :P
**Input Format :**
First line of input is t (no. of test cases) then next each t lines will contain two integers n (no. that is to be checked), m.
**Output Format :**
Print in a each output line Case no. and "YES." if a number is a handsome number otherwise "NO.". (with a dot)
```
Case_#i_:_YES.
Case_#j_:_NO.
```
Here, '\_' refers to a single space.
**Constraints :**
t <= 100
2 <= n <= 10^9
1 <= m <= 10^8
**Sample Input :**
2
6 5
100 45
**Sample Output :**
Case #1 : YES.
Case #2 : YES.
**Explanation :**
Case #1 : proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 i.e sum = 6 , taking mod with 5, i.e 1. Now no. of proper divisors of 1 is a Fibonacci number.</div>
