<h1>VECTAR14 - Changu with subsequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Changu likes to play with string and subsequences. He has thought of a puzzle for you. Can you answer him?
He gives you a sequence of '(' and ')' . Your task is to find out the number of its **different subsequences** that are regular bracket sequences.
For example, the sequence “()()” has 3 such subsequences: “()()”, “()”, and “”. As the number can be large, you have to output answer modulus 1000000007.
**Input:**
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, each containing a sequence of '(' and ')'.
****Output:****
For each test case, print the requires answer.
Sample Input:
2
()
()()
