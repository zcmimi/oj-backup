<h1>RRSCHED - Round-Robin Scheduling</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A computer processor is given N tasks to perform (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000). The i-th task requires T $ _{i} $ seconds of processing time (1 ≤ T $ _{i} $ ≤ 1,000,000,000). The processor runs the tasks as follows: each task is run in order, from 1 to N, for 1 second, and then the processor repeats this again starting from task 1. Once a task has been completed, it will not be run in later iterations. Determine, for each task, the total running time elapsed once the task has been completed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains the integer N, and the next N lines contain the integers T $ _{1} $ through T $ _{N} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output N lines, the i-th of which contains an integer representing the time elapsed when task i has been processed.</div>
