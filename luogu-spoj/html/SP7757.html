<h1>MFLAR10 - Flowers Flourish from France</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating poetical form. Tautograms are a special case alliteration, which is the occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent words. In particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words start with the same letter.
For instance, the following sentences are tautograms:
- Flowers Flourish from France
- Sam Simmonds speaks softly
- Peter pIckEd pePPers
- truly tautograms triumph
Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she wrote down is a tautogram or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Each test case is given in a single line that contains a sentence. A sentence consists of a sequence of at most 50 words separated by single spaces. A word is a sequence of at most 20 contiguous uppercase and lowercase letters from the English alphabet. A word contains at least one letter and a sentence contains at least one word.
The last test case is followed by a line containing only a single character ‘\*’ (asterisk).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case output a single line containing an uppercase ‘Y’ if the sentence is a tautogram, or an uppercase ‘N’ otherwise.</div>
