<h1>SUMMATION - SUMMATION</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an array of integer. You have to find the sum of all possible subsuquences sum of the array. For example: The given array of length n = 3 is {1,2,3}. All the sequence of this array with the corresponding array Summations are:
Subsequence

{3}
3
{1,2}
3
{1,3}
4
{2,3}
5
{1,2,3}
6
Total
24
The answer is 24.
**Input**
The first line of input will contain the test case **T (1 <= T <= 10)**.There will be two lines for each test case. First line will contain the value of **n(1<=n<=1000)** and the next line will contain the array elements space sperated intergers. Each integer will be between 1 and 1000000000.
**Output**
For each case of input, output the answer of the problem in the format "**Case X: Y**" where **X** denotes the number of test case and **Y** denotes the answer. Answer could be very large so output the answer modulo **100000007**.</div>
