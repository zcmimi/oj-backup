<h1>AND - Magic Bitwise AND Operation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given **n** integers, your task is to pick **k** out of them so that the picked number are minimum when do bitwise AND among all of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are multiple test cases for this problem. The first line of the input contains an integer denoting the number of test cases.
For each test case, there are two integers in the first line: **n** and **k**, denoting the number of given integers and the number of integers you are asked to pick out. (1<= **n** <=40, 1<= **k** <= **n**)
The second line contains the n integers. You may assume that all integers are smaller than 2 $ ^{60} $ .
_Note: There are about one thousand randomly generated test cases. Fortunately 90% of them are relatively small._</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output only one integer - the smallest possible value.</div>
