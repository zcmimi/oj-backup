<h1>BLAMOEBA - Super Amoeba</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Peter has an amoeba farm with pretty much unlimited amoebae. After years of research, Peter created a device to convert some amoebae to super amoebae. However, his device can only be used once. Every day, a super amoeba will split into M super amoebae (2 < M < 100000).
Now, Peter plan his amoeba selling business. Initially, Peter converts X amoebae to super amoebae (X > 1). Every day after the amoebae split, Peter will take Y super amoebae for sale (Y > 1). After N days, Peter want all of his amoebae to be completely sold out (1 < N < 100000). Since the energy needed to convert amoebae is quite massive, X must be as small as possible. Help peter plan his business!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line is T, number of test cases (T < 100000). Next T lines each contains M and N separated by space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case, output X and Y separated by space. Since X and Y can be very large, output them with modulo 1000000007.</div>
