<h1>TOANDFRO - To and Fro</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>请你破译一个密码，密码加密的方式如下：
- 首先画一个其中一边长为L的长方形格子
- 然后把你的句子竖向从左到右写进去，保证整个句子都被写在格子里面，并且没有多余的空格
- 将这个格子里的字母按横向S形的顺序写出来，就是加密的密码
---
输入包含若干组数据，每组数据有两行，第一行是对于破译这个密码所需用到的的L的值，第二行是一个字符串，加密后的密码。保证这个字符串的长度是L的倍数。输入以0结尾。 输出包含若干行，对于输入给出的每个密码，输出破译后的原文。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mo and Larry have devised a way of encrypting messages. They first decide secretly on the number of columns and write the message (letters only) down the columns, padding with extra random letters so as to make a rectangular array of letters. For example, if the message is “There’s no place like home on a snowy night” and there are five columns, Mo would write down
```
t o i o y
h p k n n
e l e a i
r a h s g
e c o n h
s e m o t
n l e w x
```
Note that Mo includes only letters and writes them all in lower case. In this example, Mo used the character ‘x’ to pad the message out to make a rectangle, although he could have used any letter. Mo then sends the message to Larry by writing the letters in each row, alternating left-to-right and right-to-left. So, the above would be encrypted as
`toioynnkpheleaigshareconhtomesnlewx`Your job is to recover for Larry the original message (along with any extra padding letters) from the encrypted one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There will be multiple input sets. Input for each set will consist of two lines. The first line will contain an integer in the range 2...20 indicating the number of columns used. The next line is a string of up to 200 lower case letters. The last input set is followed by a line containing a single 0, indicating end of input.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each input set should generate one line of output, giving the original plaintext message, with no spaces.</div>
