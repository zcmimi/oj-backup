<h1>POLYEQ - Polynomial Equations</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given the polynomial F(x) as the sum of monomials. Each monomial has the form:
\[_coefficient_\*\]_x_\[^_degree_\] or \[_coefficient_\],
where _coefficient_ and _degree_ are integers such that -30000 <= _coefficient_ <= 30000, 0 <= _degree_ <= 6. The parameters given in \[\] can be skipped.
In this problem you have to find all solutions of the equation: F(x)=0.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>_t_ – the number of test cases, then _t_ test cases follow. \[_t_ <= 100\]
Each line contains one polynomial _F(x)_ given as string _s_ in the form described above.
The length of string _s_ is not more than 300 characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output all solutions (including repeated) of the given equation in non-decreasing order. All solutions lie within the interval \[-100.0; 100.0\]. Each solution must be given with an error of not more than 0.01. It's guaranteed that all solutions are real, not complex.</div>
