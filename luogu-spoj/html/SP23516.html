<h1>ODWS - One day with string</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Rafa always interested in string problem and playing with string when feel bored. One day he is trying to write all the string which is lexicographically larger than string s and lexicographically smaller than string t and the length of the strings are same as the length of s and t. The string s and t consist of lowercase English letters of same length. After a few moment he got tired and thinking to solve it with computer. As he is so tired he want you to write a program to find how many string exist for the given constrains.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input starts with the number of test cases T (T<=100). Each input contains
two lines, the first line contains string s (1 of lowercase English letters. Here, |s| denotes the length of the
string.
The second line contains string t (|t| = |s|), consisting of lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the lengths of strings s and t are the same and string s is lexicographically less than string t.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the case number and the result. Since the result may be large you should print the result modulo 1,000,000,007. For better understand check the input and output given below.</div>
