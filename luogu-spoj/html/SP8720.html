<h1>GAME2 - Looks like Nim - but it is not</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div> 戈兰和斯杰潘玩了一个有趣的游戏。在他们之间的桌子上，有N座由乐高积木建成的摩天大楼。它们都是由相同的砖块组成的，每个砖块都有一个高度，这个高度等于砖块的数量。
Goran先开始;然后是Stjepan，然后是Goran，然后是Stjepan等等。在每一步中，玩家必须找到序列中最高的摩天大楼(如果有多个摩天大楼最高，他会选择其中任何一座)并降低其高度——也就是说，从其中拿走任意数量的砖块。
游戏的胜利者是拿走最后一块砖的人。
帮助戈兰，告诉他有多少打第一步并且一定可以赢的方法(无论Stjepan打得如何)。如果戈兰根本没有获胜的策略，那么获胜的方法就为零。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Goran and Stjepan play an interesting game. On the table between them, there is a sequence of N skyscrapers made of Lego bricks. All of them are made of equal bricks and each of them has a height, which equals the number of bricks in it.
Goran plays first; then Stjepan, then Goran, then Stjepan and so on. In each move, a player has to find the **highest** skyscraper in the sequence (if there's more than one, he chooses any of them) and reduces its height - that is, takes away an arbitrary (positive) number of bricks from it.
The winner of the game is the one who takes away the last brick. Equivalently, the loser of the game is the one who is not able to make a move.
Help Goran and tell him in how many ways he can play his first move, so that he can certainly win (no matter how Stjepan played). If Goran doesn't have a winning strategy at all, the number of ways is zero.</div>
