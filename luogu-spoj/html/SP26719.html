<h1>NUMPATH - Gutibazi</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Xunayed is furious. He found out that his friend Nurulla who is just like his brother (tore ami bae bhabsilam), did some gutibazi with him. Xunayed can forgive anything, but gutibazi is something he can never forgive. But to give Nurulla a lesson Xunayed first has to go to Nurulla through some path. Then the problem occurs. Roads belong to a very powerful individual named Rizvi and everyone has to take permission from him to pass those roads. Rizvi will give permission to Xunayed only if Xunayed can solve a riddle.
Path is some 2d grid. Xunayed is currently on upper left cell (cell (1,1) in the figure below) which is source. Nurulla is now on lower right cell (cell (3,3) in the figure below) which is destination. Xunayed can only go down/right from his current cell. **In how many ways there exists a path where Xunayed can reach Nurulla.**
**![grid](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DdOeWcMdcHM/VvP2X-ERMQI/AAAAAAAABDI/VFp5Y5MKmso-s7EgwFIjwVStq0RVotaZA/s1600/img.jpg "example grid")**
Solve this riddle to help innocent Xunayed and bring forth justice.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
