<h1>DCEPC705 - Weird Points</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given N distinct points in a plane, a point (x1, y1) is said to be dominating another point (x2, y2) if x1>=x2 and y1>=y2.
The Dominance of a point is the absolute difference between 2 quantities – no. of points dominated by this point and no. of points not dominated by this point. **(excluding itself)**
A Weird point is the point whose Dominance value is greater than or equal to a threshold value ‘k’. Find the no. of such Weird Points among those N given points.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line gives T, the no. of test cases.
Each test case consists of 2 integers in first line, N and K, as specified above.
Next N lines give the coordinates of N points in the plane. “Xi” and “Yi” are space separated.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output T lines, each containing the required answer.</div>
