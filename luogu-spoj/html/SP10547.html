<h1>DELIVER - Delivery Route</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>平面上有N个点，其坐标均为整数，每个点被标上编号。一个人１分钟可上下左右移动一个坐标单位。要求该人从第１点开始依次按编号访问第2点、3点最后从第Ｎ点回到第１点，除第１点外，每点只访问一次。求所需花的最少时间。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After several years of record milk production, Farmer John now operates an entire network of N farms (1 <= N <= 100). Farm i is located at position (x\_i, y\_i) in the 2D plane, distinct from all other farms, with both x\_i and y\_i being integers. FJ needs your help planning his daily delivery route to bring supplies to the N farms. Starting from farm 1, he plans to visit the farms sequentially (farm 1, then farm 2, then farm 3, etc.), finally returning to farm 1 after visiting farm N. It tames FJ one minute to make a single step either north, south, east, or west. Furthermore, FJ wants to visit each farm exactly once during his entire journey (except farm 1, which he visits twice of course). Please help FJ determine the minimum amount of time it will take him to complete his entire delivery route.
INPUT FORMAT: \* Line 1: The number of farms, N. \* Lines 2..1+N: Line i+1 contains two space-separated integers, x\_i and y\_i (1 <= x\_i, y\_i <= 1,000,000).
Example:
4
2 2
2 4
2 1
1 3
OUTPUT FORMAT: \* Line 1: The minimum number of minutes FJ needs to complete his delivery route, or -1 if it is impossible to find a feasible delivery route that visits every farm exactly once (except farm 1).
output example:
12
Output Details: FJ can complete his delivery route in 12 minutes: 2 minutes to go from farm 1 to farm 2, 5 minutes to go from farm 2 to farm 3 (circumventing farm 1), 3 minutes to go from farm 3 to farm 4, and then 2 minutes to return to farm 1.</div>
