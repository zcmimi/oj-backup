<h1>MKWAVES - Making Waves</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Suppose we know a signal is generated by the function x sin (_f $ _{1} $ t_) sin (_f $ _{2} $ t_). F1 and f2 are two unique frequencies, each having an integral value in the range 400 to 600 Hz (Hz = cycles per second), and t represents time. In this problem, you will be given N samples of this function at equally-spaced time intervals corresponding to t = 1/N, t = 2/N, and so forth. From these samples, you are to determine f1 and f2.
For example, suppose f1 = 400 Hz, f2 = 500 Hz, and N = 100. The first sample, at time t = 1/100 sec, is equal to sin(400 0.01) sin(500 0.01) sin(4) sin(5) 0.156912 . Similarly, the second sample, at time t = 2/100 sec, is equal to sin(400 0.02) sin(500 0.02) sin(8) sin(10) 0.312821.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There will be multiple cases to consider. Each case begins with an integer N, no larger than 1000, that specifies the number of signal samples. The next N data items are real numbers representing the signal samples at time 1/N sec, 2/N sec, and so forth. A single integer 0 follows the last case.
The number of samples for each case is guaranteed to be sufficient to allow the correct result to be obtained.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input case, display a single line that is formatted like this:
Case 1, f1 = 400, f2 = 500</div>
