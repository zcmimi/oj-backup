<h1>UNICA - Unique Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Some people who love strings have decided to call a special group of strings as the **“unique strings.”**
Let’s define **a(S)** as the number of characters “a” the string S contains, and **b(S)** as the number of characters “b” the string S contains.
S is a unique string if:
1\) S only contains the characters “a” and “b”
2\) For every substring S’of S, | a(S’) – b(S’) | <= 3
For example, “abbab” is a unique string. However, “abbbba” is not because it includes the substring “bbbb” for which | a(“bbbb”) – b(“bbbbb”) | = 4 > 3.
Let’s say we sort the unique strings – **first by length and then lexicographically**. The N $ ^{th} $ unique string is the string that appears in the position N in the sorted list. The first unique string is assigned the number 1.
The first 12 unique strings in the sorted list are: **a, b, aa, ab,ba, bb, aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab**</div>
