<h1>FUNFACT - Factorial challenge</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ling: Stir, let's go out and play our favorite game.
Stir: I am already having fun with my first factorial program.
Ling: Than I will give you a challenge on factorials. If you fail in it, you will have to come.
Stir: ok..
Ling gives Stir a number x and the challenge is to find the largest value of n such that n! is not greater than the largest value that can be formed by x digits. Stir is stuck with the problem and needs your help. Now, it's your turn to make sure that Stir can continue having fun with factorials.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a number t (about 10^5), the number of the test cases. The next t lines contain a number x (1 <= x <= 10^9).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a total of t lines with each line containing the value n corresponding to the input case.</div>
