<h1>REDSUBLIA - Single substitutions</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the land of Redsublia, they always write words with exactly one letter changed. All words are 6 letters long, made up of lower-case characters from a-z. So if the word was abcdef, they might write gbcdef or azcdef.
Of course, this means that sometimes when they write a word, it might be ambiguous.
In school, they are given some words to learn, and then tested on them. Of course, in the tests, the words are written with one letter changed for another. Sometimes, they are tested with words that don't exist, or are ambiguous. They are asked to find the lexicographically smallest word that matches out of the words that they have learned so far.
Bugsy is struggling at school. Please help him.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains N, the number of test cases.
The next line contains L the number of lines in the input for this test-case.
Each line will either add a word to the dictionary
`W <word>`Or suggest a word to look up in the dictionary so far.
`Q <query>`</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line should contain:
`Test <test case>`Then for each line of input that is a query, print the (lexicographically smallest) word. If there are no possible words, print 0.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>1\n6\nW abcdef\nQ bacdef\nQ abcdef\nW abadef\nQ abcdeg\nQ abgdef\n</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>\nTest 1\n0\n0\nabcdef\nabadef\n</code></pre>
