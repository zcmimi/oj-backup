<h1>LLCA - Largest Labeled Common Ancestor</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a labeled complete k-ary tree, find the largest labeled common ancestor of two given nodes. In a complete k-ary tree, the node in the tree is labeled sequentially from the left most child to right most child, level by level. Largest labeled common ancestor of A and B is defined as the largest labeled node in the tree which has A and B as descendants. A node is a descendant of itself.
**Be careful with your finger, the source limit is 256 bytes.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 <= T <= 100) the number of cases. Each cases contains three integers K, A and B (2 <= K <= 100; 1 <= A,B <= 2,000,000,000).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output in a line the largest labeled common ancestor node.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
