<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are multiple test cases in the input file.
Each test case starts with two integers, R and C (1 <= R,C <= 500), specifying the number of rows / columns of the graph. Each of the following R lines contains consecutive C characters ("0" or "1"), describing the image to be processed.
Two successive test cases are separated by a blank line. A case with R = 0, C = 0 indicates the end of the input file, and should not be processed by your program.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, please print a single integer, the sum of recognizable numbers. See the sample output for format details.</div>
