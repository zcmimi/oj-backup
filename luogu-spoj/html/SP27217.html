<h1>SQRMINSUM - Minimum Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>```
Suppose you have a list of integers, and a move is defined as taking one of the integers from the list and replacing it with its square root, rounded down to the nearest integer.
Given an integer l and an integer k, start with the array [1, 2, 3, ..., l] and find the minimal sum of the array after k moves.
Example
For l = 5 and k = 2, the output should besquareRoots(l, k) = 10.
We start with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].After square rooting 5 to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 2] and then square rooting 3 to get[1, 2, 1, 4, 2], we end up with a sum of 10.Constraints:1
