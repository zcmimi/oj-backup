<h1>REBOUND - The return of the Cake</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>It is well known that, in byteland, when you throw a cake, the angle of reflexion is not the angle of incidence. Measured from the ground, the angle is the double, in byteland!
![rebound](../../content/francky:rebound-fig2 "rebound")
You stand at point A(0, z), and you want to throw a cake in Leo's face. Leo stands at B(x, y) and is a very dangerous man, so you decide to use the ground in order to make your cake rebound.
Your shot is precise only if you can use an integer value t in the intervall \[0, x\], in order to reflect on C(t, 0). Sometimes it's possible, sometimes not!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line. In each of the next T lines there are three integers x, y and z, explaining the locations : you A(0, z), Leo B(x, y).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, find and print the only integer t such 0 <= t <= x, that allow this perfect shot. If it's not possible, output "Not this time.".</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
