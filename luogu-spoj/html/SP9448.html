<h1>SWARM - Swarm of Polygons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a regular n-gon. Some points are marked on each of its sides. There are x $ _{1} $ point marked on the first side, x $ _{2} $ – on the second, …, x $ _{n} $ – on the nth. The marked points do not coincide with the vertices of the n-gon. You can choose no more than one of the marked points from each side and form a convex non-degenerate polygon by connecting all those points with lines. Now your task is to find the number of different k-gons that can be formed that way.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input file contains positive integer t – the amount of test cases. Next t lines contain six integers each: n, k, a, b, c, m. Here n is the number of sides of the initial n-gon. The amount of marked points on the first side of this n-gon is x $ _{1} $ = a, the amount of the marked points on the following sides is x $ _{i} $ = (b\*x $ _{i-1} $ + c) mod m, for i > 1.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output the number of k-gons that can be formed modulo 1000000007.</div>
