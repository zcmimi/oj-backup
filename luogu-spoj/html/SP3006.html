<h1>LINE - Connect Line Segments</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Your dear son Arnie is addicted to a puzzle named _Connect Line Segments_.
In this puzzle, you are given several line segments placed on a two-dimensional area. You are allowed to add some new line segments each connecting the end points of two existing line segments. The objective is to form a single polyline, by connecting all given line segments, as short as possible. The resulting polyline is allowed to intersect itself.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP3006/1401d11be7a6ed8569822f3f2663b356bf4dd71a.png)Arnie has solved many instances by his own way, but he is wondering if his solutions are the best one. He knows you are a good programmer, so he asked you to write a computer program with which he can verify his solutions.
Please respond to your dear Arnie’s request.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of multiple test cases.
Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer _n_ (2 ≤ _n_ ≤ 14), which is the number of the initial line segments. The following _n_ lines are the description of the line segments. The _i_-th line consists of four real numbers: _x $ _{i,1} $_ , _y $ _{i,1} $_ , _x $ _{i,2} $_ , and _y $ _{i,2} $_ (-100 ≤ _x $ _{i,1} $_ , _y $ _{i,1} $_ , _x $ _{i,2} $_ , _y $ _{i,2} $_ ≤ 100). (_x $ _{i,1} $_ , _y $ _{i,1} $_ ) and (_x $ _{i,2} $_ , _y $ _{i,2} $_ ) are the coordinates of the end points of the _i_-th line segment.
The end of the input is indicated by a line with single "0".</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output the case number followed by the minimum length in a line.
The output value should be printed with five digits after the decimal point.</div>
