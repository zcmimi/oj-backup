<h1>BALLOT - Distributing Ballot Boxes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>今天，除了SWERC'11，另一个重要事件正在西班牙发生，它的重要性与之竞争：大选。该国18岁或以上的每一位居民都被要求投票，以便选出代表大会和参议院的代表。你不必担心所有的法官都会突然逃避他们的监督职责，因为投票不是强制性的。
政府有许多投票箱，这些投票箱是在过去的选举中使用的。不幸的是，负责在城市间分配箱子的人几个月前因为财政限制被解雇了。因此，将投票箱分配给城市以及必须在每个城市中投票的人的名单无疑不是最好的。你的任务是展示这项任务的效率。
将投票箱分配给城市的唯一规则是每个城市必须至少分配一个投票箱。每个人必须在他/她之前被分配到的投票框中投票。您的目标是获得一个分配，使分配到一个框中投票的最大人数最小化。
在样本输入的第一个案例中，两个框分别指向第一个城市和第二个城市，并且每个框中都有10万人参与投票（巨大！）最有效的投票箱。在第二种情况下，将1、2、2、1个投票箱分配给城市，并要求来自第三个城市的1700人在各自村庄的两个投票箱中进行投票，使这些投票箱在最佳分配中成为最拥挤的投票箱。
## 输入
每个测试用例的第一行包含整数n（1<=n<=500000）、城市数和投票箱数b（n<=b<=2000000）。以下n行中的每一行包含一个整数a i（1<=a i<=5000000），表示第i个城市的人口。
每种情况发生后将包含一个空白行。输入的最后一行将包含-1-1，不应进行处理。
## 输出
对于每种情况，程序都应该输出一个整数，即在最有效的分配中分配给一个框的最大人数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today, besides SWERC’11, another important event is taking place in Spain which rivals it in importance: General Elections. Every single resident of the country aged 18 or over is asked to vote in order to choose representatives for the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. You do not need to worry that all judges will suddenly run away from their supervising duties, as voting is not compulsory.
The administration has a number of ballot boxes, those used in past elections. Unfortunately, the person in charge of the distribution of boxes among cities was dismissed a few months ago due to financial restraints. As a consequence, the assignment of boxes to cities and the lists of people that must vote in each of them is arguably not the best. Your task is to show how efficiently this task could have been done.
The only rule in the assignment of ballot boxes to cities is that every city must be assigned at least one box. Each person must vote in the box to which he/she has been previously assigned. Your goal is to obtain a distribution which minimizes the maximum number of people assigned to vote in one box.
In the first case of the sample input, two boxes go to the first city and the rest to the second, and exactly 100,000 people are assigned to vote in each of the (huge!) boxes in the most efficient distribution. In the second case, 1, 2, 2 and 1 ballot boxes are assigned to the cities and 1,700 people from the third city will be called to vote in each of the two boxes of their village, making these boxes the most crowded of all in the optimal assignment.
**Input**
The first line of each test case contains the integers _N_ (1 N B (_N_ B N lines contains an integer _a_ $ _{i} $ , (1 a $ _{i} $ i $ ^{th} $ city.
