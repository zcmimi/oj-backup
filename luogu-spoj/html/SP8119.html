<h1>CIRUT - CIRU2</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given N **different** circles , while some region may be covered more than once.
If one region is covered by K times, then it was called a "K- Region".
So, you are expected to output the area of all the regions! (K from 1 to N)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is one integer n indicates the number of the circles. (1 <= n <= 1000)
Then follows n lines every line has three integers
Xi Yi Ri
indicates the coordinate of the center of the circle, and the radius. (|Xi|. |Yi| <= 1000, 0 < Ri <= 1000)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output N lines, the i-th line output
\[i\] = area\_of\_i\_region
here the area must round to 3 digits after decimal point.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3\n0 0 1\n1 0 1\n1 1 1\n\n</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>[1] = 4.699\n[2] = 1.699\n[3] = 0.443\n</code></pre>
