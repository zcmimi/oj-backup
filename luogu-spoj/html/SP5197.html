<h1>DIFFDIAG - Differential Diagnosis</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Daniel enjoys watching TV series. One of his favorite is "Doctor Chaos". In this series the medical genius is saving people by making difficult diagnosis. In his work he employs the differential diagnosis method. Doctor Chaos writes all the symptoms the patient have on the white board and his team tries to find out the disease which explains those symptoms best. Sometimes some symptoms are not caused by the disease itself. Sometimes some symptoms are not revealed yet and are not written on the board. Anyhow the team chooses come candidate-diseases and then runs the tests to identify the right one. Help Doctor Chaos by making a program which find out the diseases that are explaining the set of symptoms the best way. We'll say that the disease explains the set of symptoms the best way if it explains the most symptoms from the set among all known diseases.</div>

Then there go the names of the symptoms separated by spaces. After the description of all the diseases there is number **t** - the amount of cases to diagnose. After that **t** lines follow each containing a set of symptoms. Each set starts with the number **q** - the amount of different symptoms. Then **q** names of the symptoms follow separated by spaces.
