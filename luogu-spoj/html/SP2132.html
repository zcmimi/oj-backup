<h1>PUZZLE2 - Puzzle</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>山姆喜欢各种各样的谜题。最近他收到了一个非常特别的谜题 - 一个N×M方格的网格，每个方格都由红色或蓝色鹅卵石占据。拼图由几个按钮控制。
网格的每一行都有相应的黑色按钮。当您按下黑色按钮时，拼图的复杂机制会翻转与该按钮对应的行中所有鹅卵石的颜色（此行中的所有红色鹅卵石都变为蓝色，反之亦然）。
网格的每列都有相应的白色按钮。当您同时按下两个白色按钮时，拼图机制会交换与这些按钮对应的两列的内容，而不会更改列中鹅卵石的顺序。
Sam发现这个谜题非常有趣。不幸的是，他昨天借给了他的女儿安。她能够很快理解这个谜题的想法，并给了他这个戏弄的任务。她画了两个安排 - 初始和最后，她根据最初的安排改变了鹅卵石的颜色。Sam的任务是决定是否存在一系列拼图操作，将拼图的初始排列转换为最终排列。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sam loves all kinds of puzzles. Recently he received a very special puzzle - a grid of N x M squares, each square is occupied either by a red or by a blue pebble. The puzzle is controlled by several buttons.
Each row of the grid has its corresponding black button. When you press a black button, a complicated mechanism of the puzzle flips the colors of all pebbles in the row corresponding to that button (all red pebbles in this row become blue and vice versa).
Each column of the grid has its corresponding white button. When you press exactly two white buttons simultaneously, the puzzle mechanism exchanges the contents of the two columns corresponding to those buttons without changing the order of the pebbles in the columns.
Sam has found the puzzle very interesting. Unfortunately, he lent it to his daughter Ann yesterday. She was able to understand the idea of the puzzle very quickly and she gave him this teasing task. She drew two arrangements - initial and final and she changed the colors of the pebbles according to the initial arrangement. Sam's task is to decide whether there exists a sequence of puzzle operations which transforms the initial arrangement of the puzzle to the final arrangement.</div>
