<h1>RTREE2 - Valid Path</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Roger was having fun solving his problems until he found this one. As you know, an undirected connected graph with **N** nodes and **N-1** edges is called a tree. You are given an integer **'K'** and a tree consisting of **'N'** nodes. Each node **'i'** has a value **a(i)** associated with it.
We call a path **'P'** of tree valid if following conditions are satisfied:
- **P** has at least 2 nodes associated with it.
- **Max a(u) - Min a(u) >= K** (u belongs to the nodes present in the choosen P).
Your task is to count the number of Valid Paths.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two space-separated integers **N** and **K**.
The second line contains **N** space-separated positive integers **a(1), a(2), ..., a(n).**
Then the next **n - 1** line each contains a pair of integers **u** and **v** denoting that there is an edge between u and v.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the number of Valid Paths.</div>
