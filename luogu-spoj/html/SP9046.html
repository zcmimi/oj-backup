<h1>HANDS - Clock Hands</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The minute hand and hour hand love each other. The ‘Second’ hand is a spy who wants to keep track on how many times they pass over each other in a given interval on a day. Help the second hand.
**Input**
First line contains the number of test cases t. Each test case has two lines representing the start time and end time respectively. The time would be in format (hh:mm). hh will be between 00 and 23, mm will be between 00 and 59. If the minute and hour hand are overlapping right at the start time (like at 12:00) then it would **not be counted**. (00:00 <= '**start time**' < '**end time**' <= 23:59)
**Output**
For each test case print, on a separate line, the number of times they overlap each other.
