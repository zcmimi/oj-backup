<h1>NEG2 - The Moronic Cowmpouter</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入一个十进制$N(-2,000,000,000\le N\le 2,000,000,000)$，输出它的$-2$进制数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Inexperienced in the digital arts, the cows tried to build a calculating engine (yes, it's a cowmpouter) using binary numbers (base 2) but instead built one based on base negative 2! They were quite pleased since numbers expressed in base -2 do not have a sign bit.
You know number bases have place values that start at 1 (base to the 0 power) and proceed right-to-left to base^1, base^2, and so on. In base -2, the place values are 1, -2, 4, -8, 16, -32, ... (reading from right to left). Thus, counting from 1 goes like this: 1, 110, 111, 100, 101, 11010, 11011, 11000, 11001, and so on.
Eerily, negative numbers are also represented with 1's and 0's but no sign. Consider counting from -1 downward: 11, 10, 1101, 1100, 1111, and so on.
Please help the cows convert ordinary decimal integers (range -2,000,000,000 .. 2,000,000,000) to their counterpart representation in base -2.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer to be converted to base -2</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer with no leading zeroes that is the input integer converted to base -2. The value 0 is expressed as 0, with exactly one 0.</div>
