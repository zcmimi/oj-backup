<h1>DECORATE - Decorate the wall</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After building his huge villa, Mr. Rich cannot help but notice that the interior walls look rather blank. To change that, he starts to hang paintings from his wonderful collection. But soon he realizes that it becomes quite difficult to find a place on the wall where a painting can be placed without overlapping other paintings. Now he needs a program which would tell him, given the already placed paintings, where to place the next painting without moving any other paintings (or indicating that this is impossible). Paintings have a rectangular shape and are to be placed parallel to the side of the wall. If you do not mind a nice reward from Mr. Rich, go on and solve the problem.</div>
