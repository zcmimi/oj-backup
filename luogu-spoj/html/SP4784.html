<h1>HS09EQ - Diophantine equation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sometimes solving a Diophantine equation is very hard. But, for example, the equation **a**+**b** $ ^{2} $ +**c** $ ^{3} $ +**d** $ ^{4} $ =**n** has a trivial solution for every value of **n**. Your task is to determine the number of solutions of the equation for each given **n**, assuming that in the equation all the values **a**, **b**, **c** and **d** are non-negative integers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains an integer **T**, representing the number of test cases (**T**
The following **T** lines contain one non-negative integer **n** each, where **n** < 10 $ ^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output **T** lines, each containing the number of solutions of the respective equation for **n**.</div>
