<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
伐木工人米科需要砍掉M米长的木头。这对他来说是件容易的工作，因为他有一台漂亮的新伐木机，可以像野火一样把森林砍倒。然而，米尔科只能砍伐一行树。
MIRKO的机器工作原理如下：MIRKO设置高度参数H（以米为单位），机器将一个巨大的锯片提升到该高度，并切断所有高于H的树木部件（当然，不高于H米的树木保持完整）。然后米尔科拿走了被切断的部分。例如，如果树行中有高度为20、15、10和17米的树，而mirko将锯片升至15米，则切割后的剩余树高分别为15、15、10和15米，而mirko将从第一棵树上取下5米，从第四棵树上取下2米（共7米的木材）。
米尔科有生态意识，所以他不想砍掉比需要更多的木头。这就是为什么他想把锯片放得尽可能高的原因。帮助Mirko找到锯条的最大整数高度，这仍然允许他砍掉至少米长的木头。
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式：
第一行输入包含两个空格分隔的正整数，n（树的数量)，1 N m（mirko要求的木材量)，1 m
第二行输入包含n个小于10000000000的空格分隔的正整数，每棵树的高度（以米为单位）。所有高度之和将超过m，因此Mirko将始终能够获得所需数量的木材。
## 输出格式：
输出的第一行和唯一一行必须包含所需的高度设置。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Lumberjack Mirko needs to chop down **M** metres of wood. It is an easy job for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can take down forests like wildfire. However, Mirko is only allowed to cut a single row of trees.
Mirko‟s machine works as follows: Mirko sets a height parameter **H** (in metres), and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts off all tree parts higher than **H** (of course, trees not higher than **H** meters remain intact). Mirko then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if the tree row contains trees with heights of 20, 15, 10, and 17 metres, and Mirko raises his sawblade to 15 metres, the remaining tree heights after cutting will be 15, 15, 10, and 15 metres, respectively, while Mirko will take 5 metres off the first tree and 2 metres off the fourth tree (7 metres of wood in total).
Mirko is **ecologically** minded, so he doesn‟t want to cut off more wood than necessary. That‟s why he wants to set his sawblade as high as possible. Help Mirko find the **maximum integer height** of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off **at least M** metres of wood.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two space-separated positive integers, **N** (the number of trees, 1 N M (Mirko‟s required wood amount, 1 M
The second line of input contains **N** space-separated positive integers less than 1 000 000 000, the heights of each tree (in metres). The sum of all heights will exceed **M**, thus Mirko will always be able to obtain the required amount of wood.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of output must contain the required height setting.</div>
