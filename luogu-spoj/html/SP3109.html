<h1>STRLCP - Longest Common Prefix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The LCP (Longest Common Prefix) of two strings A\[1..la\] and B\[1..lb\] is defined as follows:
LCP(A\[1..la\],B\[1..lb\]) = max{L | L<=la && L<=lb && A\[1..L\] == B\[1..L\]}
Given an original string and several operations, you should write a program to process all the operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line will be number of test cases T.
The first line of each test case is a string S with length L (1 <= L <= 100000).
The second line contains an integer Q(1 <= Q <= 150000), representing the number of operations.
Each of the following Q lines represents an operation:
Q i j: print LCP(S\[i..L\], S\[j..L\])
R i char: replace the i-th character of S with char
I i char: insert character char after the i-th character of S</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each "Q i j" operation, print the answer.</div>
