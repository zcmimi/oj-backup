<h1>MINSEQ - Minimal Possible String</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two strings A and B, your are to find the lexicographically smallest string after inserting B into A.
For example, string A is "369", and string B is "4799". There are 4 ways that I can insert B into A, and I’ll get 4 different results: 4799369, 3479969, 3647999, 3694799. Thus, 3479969 is the lexicographically smallest one.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input contains several cases. Each case has 2 strings A and B with length no longer than 100000 in 2 lines. Process the input until EOF. The strings consist of only digit 1-9.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case, output the minimal possible result.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>\n369\n4799\n666\n12345\n\n</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>\n3479969\n12345666</code></pre>
