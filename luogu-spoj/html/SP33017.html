<h1>ADAMOLD - Ada and Mold</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a long furrow in which she grows vegetable (while each vegetable is indentified by a bloom-value). The more vegetable is in the furrow the bigger risk of mold there is. More specificaly the mold-value can be obtained as sum of **xor** of all pairs of vegetable's bloom-values.
Ada has bought a few wooden separators which could possibly reduce the mold-value. It works in following manner: she can put the separators between some plants, dividing the furrow into multiple segments. The mold-value will then becomes the sum of mold-values of all the segments (independently). Can you find the minimal possible mold-value?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input containts two integers **N, K**: **1 , the length of furrows and the number of separators.**
The next lines will contain **N** numbers **0 , the bloom-values of vegetable.**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output the minimal possible mold-value.</div>
