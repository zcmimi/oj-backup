<h1>DCEPC200 - The Prime Minister</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>DCE Coders mentors got fed up by making problems, they are deciding upon the toughest problem for contest. Everybody started to tease Ankur sir that he can’t make a single tough problem for juniors. He got very angry, now you only handle Ankur sir’s anger (Beware: All the tough number theory problems given to you as assignments are like 2+2=4 for Ankur sir). Here is the problem given by him (Say thanks to Jyoti ma’am that she softens the problem slightly.. ;)). You are given an integer n. There will be 2 different numbers K1 and K2, such that K1\*K2 = n.
Both of which satisfies the equation (Totient(K!) mod K) !=0.
You are also given value of a function, F(n) = Sum of squares of factor of n. (example F(20) = 546)
Now you have to calculate the value of x and y which satisfies the equation K1x + K2y = m. Where m is given. Since there are many roots you have to find a single pair (x,y) which satisfies the equation having minimum absolute value of (x +y). If no pair is possible output -1. Else output **(abs(x+y)^m)%mod**</div>
