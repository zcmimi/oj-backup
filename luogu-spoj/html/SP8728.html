<h1>MAKETREE - Hierarchy</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A group of graduated students decided to establish a company; however, they don't agree on who is going to be who's boss.
Generally, one of the students will be the **main** boss, and each of the other students will have exactly one boss (and that boss, if he is not the main boss, will have a boss of his own too). Every boss will have a strictly greater salary than all of his subordinates - therefore, there are no cycles. Therefore, the hierarchy of the company can be represented as a rooted **tree**.
In order to agree on who is going to be who's boss, they've chosen K most successful students, and each of them has given a statement: I want to be the superior of him, him, and him (they could be successful or unsuccessful). And what does it mean to be a superior? It means to be the boss, or to be one of the boss' superiors (therefore, a superior of a student is not necessary his direct boss).
Help this immature company and create a hierarchy that will satisfy all of the successful students' wishes. A solution, not necessary unique, will exist in all of the test data.</div>
