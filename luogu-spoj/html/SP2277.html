<h1>SSORT - Silly Sort</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Your younger brother has an assignment and needs some help. His teacher gave him a sequence of numbers to be sorted in ascending order. During the sorting process, the places of two numbers can be interchanged. Each interchange has a cost, which is the sum of the two numbers involved.
You must write a program that determines the minimal cost to sort the sequence of numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input file contains several test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (n>1), representing the number of items to be sorted. The second line contains n different integers (each positive and less than 1000), which are the numbers to be sorted.
The input is terminated by a zero on a line by itself.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, the output is a single line containing the test case number and the minimal cost of sorting the numbers in the test case.
Place a blank line after the output of each test case.</div>
