<h1>SUMPRIM2 - Sum of primes (reverse mode)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>XerK had prepared his new problem with some sums of primes up to some bounds. His results are well here, but he forgot the bounds. Your task is to find which was the last prime in the sum. This problem is extremely simple, but you have to be extremely fast.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The lonely line of input contains an integer **_S_**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You have to print the last prime **_P_** such that **_sum(prime from 2 to P) = S_**.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
