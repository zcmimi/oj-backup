<h1>FRS2 - Fibonaccibonacci (easy)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Leo would like to play with some really big numbers, OK...
Let FIB the Fibonacci function :
FIB(0)=0 ; FIB(1)=1
and
for N>=2 FIB(N) = FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)
Example : we have FIB(6)=8, and FIB(8)=21, so FIB(FIB(6))=21</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.
In each of the next T lines there are an integer N.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print FIB(FIB(N)) ,
as the answer could not fit in a 64bit container,
give your answer modulo 1000000007.</div>
