<h1>SEGMENTS - Segments</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are N horizontal line segments in the plane. The ith segment has some height h $ _{i} $ (which may be negative) and runs from x = a $ _{i} $ to x = b $ _{i} $ (a $ _{i} $ < b $ _{i} $ ). Segments do not contain their endpoints. You must draw a set of vertical lines (note _lines_ and not _line segments_) so that every given horizontal segment is intersected at least once and at most R times by vertical lines in such a way that R is minimized.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input is N (1 ≤ N ≤ 400), the number of horizontal line segments. N lines then follow, where the ith line is "a $ _{i} $ b $ _{i} $ h $ _{i} $ ". Each of a $ _{i} $ ,b $ _{i} $ ,h $ _{i} $ are 32-bit signed integers. Horizontal segments may overlap.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your output should consist of a single integer, the smallest value of R that is achievable, followed by a newline.</div>
