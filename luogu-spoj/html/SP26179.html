<div>~~我绝对不是因为加农炮的插图的好看才翻译它的~~
~~原来这么简单~~
这一天非常多风，风速甚至比加农炮弹的速度还快。在这个多风的日子里，Gunawan想要测试他的新原型加农炮，他希望射中特定的目标。但在这之前，他想知道炮弹需要多久才能射中目标。他知道加农炮的精确位置，目标的方位，加农炮的速度，风速，以及风向。糟糕的是，他忘记带他的计算器了。所以他向你寻求帮助，请你算出炮弹射中目标所需的最小时间，若不可能，请说明。你可以假设炮弹相对于风的速度是恒定的，所有其他物理效应如重力、空气摩擦、温度、马格努斯效应都被忽略了。
**输入**
第一行包括4个整数和1个字符CP、TP、CBS、WS、WD，分别表示加农炮位置（M）、目标位置（M）、炮弹速度（M/S）、风速（M/S）和风向。
**输出**
输出炮弹击中目标所需的最小秒数（保留小数点后六位）。
如果炮弹不可能击中目标，那么在没有引号的情况下打印“Impossible”。
如果WD＝“L”，则意味着风吹向负方向（笛卡尔平面的左侧）。
如果WD＝“R”，则意味着风吹向正方向（笛卡尔平面的右侧）。
**样例4解释**
炮弹的速度为2米/秒，所以如果向右射击，因为风向为左且风速为3米/秒，炮弹移动（3-2＝1）米/秒，相对于地面向左移动，最终将在8秒内击中目标，但这不是最优方案，向左边射击炮弹更快，因为风向为左且风速为3米/秒（和炮弹相对于风移动的方向相同），所以炮弹将移动（3＋2＝5）m/s，相对于地面向左移动，最终将击中目标A。T（10-2）/ 5＝8/5＝1.6秒。我们的结果需要在小数点后保留6位，因此炮弹到达目标所需的最小时间是1.600000秒。

<div>**Windy Cannon**

This day is very windy, the wind blow very fast that it may be faster than the speed of cannon ball. On this windy day, Gunawan want to test his new prototype cannon, he want to shoot the target at specific location. But before doing that, he wonder how long it take for the cannon ball to hit the target. He know percisely the position of his cannon, the location of the target, the speed of his cannon ball, the speed of wind blows, and the direction of the wind, but unfortunately he forgot to bring the calculator so he ask you for help to calculate the minimum time needed for the cannon ball to hit the target or specify if it's impossible. Can you help him? You can assume that the speed of cannon ball relative to the wind is constant, all other physical effect such as gravity, air friction, temperature, magnus effect are ignored.
**Input**
The first line there are 4 integers and 1 character CP, TP, CBS, WS, WD denoting cannon position (m), target position (m), cannon ball speed (m/s), wind speed (m/s), and wind direction respectively.
**Output**
Print how many seconds the minimum time needed for cannon ball to hit the target rounded to 6 digits after decimal point.
If it's impossible for the cannon ball to hit the target, print "Impossible" without quotes.
**Constraint**

if WD = 'L', it means that the wind blow into negative direction (left in catesian plane).
if WD = 'R' it means that the wind blow into positive direction (right in cartesian plane).

The cannon ball move at speed 2 m/s relative to the wind, so if it shoot to the right, because of the wind blowing 3 m/s to the left relative to the ground, the cannon ball move (3-2=1) m/s to the left relative to the ground and will eventually hit the target in 8 seconds, but this is not optimal, it's faster to shoot the cannon ball to the left, because the wind blowing 3 m/s to the left relative to the ground (and the same direction as the cannon ball move relative to the wind), so the cannon ball will move (3+2=5) m/s to the left relative to the ground and will eventually hit the target at (10-2)/5 = 8/5 = 1.6 seconds. We need to print the result rounded to 6 digit after decimal places, so the minimum time needed for the cannon ball to reach the target is 1.600000 seconds.</div>
