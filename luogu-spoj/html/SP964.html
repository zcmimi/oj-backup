<h1>EN - Entrapment</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> ![Example](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP964/274688e224c10fff7d6178c2cb3ecd6ca08f7845.png) The separatist leader General Grievous, the second in command of Count Dooku, comes to know that Chancellor Palpatine’s convoy, escorted by Obi-wan and Anakin, is scheduled to depart from **Kashyyyk** in the Middle Rim of the Universe to **Alderaan**. General Grievous is aware that there are multiple paths going via different sets of planets from Kashyyyk to Alderaan. To make his abduction attempt successful, he decides to send his robots to the planet closest to Kashyyyk, other than itself, which lies on all the possible paths from Kashyyyk to Alderaan. Since you have pledged your allegiance to Count Dooku, you need to help him identify this planet. The planetary map which is given to you for this purpose consists of a set of one-way connections between planets. You also know that a pair of planets can have at most one connection between them in each direction and there is always a path from Kashyyyk to Alderaan.
**Note**: In the given example, the planet with index 5 is the required planet.</div>
