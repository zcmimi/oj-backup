<h1>AMR11I - Generations</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Harry's friend Charlie Weasley has partnered with an old-time breeder of dragons in Romania. When Harry visited Charlie over the summer, Charlie showed him breeding records stretching back centuries. It had started out with just one female dragon named Abraxia that had then reproduced to give many generations of dragons. The breeding record showed a family tree of dragons, starting with Abraxia and showing each descendant\* (only females' descendants were shown), the year each was hatched from its egg and the year each died. Only already dead dragons were included. Charlie pointed out that a dragon matured early, and once hatched, could herself lay and hatch an egg in the very year it was born. Dragon eggs did not need a mother's care to hatch -- the breeders simply used the warmth of a blowtorch to keep the egg warm and hatch it, sometimes long after the mother dragon was dead.</div>
