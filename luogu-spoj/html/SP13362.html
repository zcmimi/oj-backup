<h1>KMEDIAL - Median of sub-sequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let a given sequence S (of length n) of positive integers be called x-medial (where x is a positive integer) if:
1. n is odd, and the median of the sequence (the ((n+1)/2) $ ^{th} $ largest term) equals x. **OR**
2. n is even, and both the central terms ( (n/2) $ ^{th} $ largest and (n/2+1) $ ^{th} $ largest) are equal to x.
Given a sequence A (of length N) of positive integers and an integer k, find out how many of its sub-sequences are k-medial.
A sub-sequence of A is any sequence {A\[i\], A\[i+1\], A\[i+2\]... , A\[j\]}, where 0</div>
