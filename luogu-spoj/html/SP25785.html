<div>![ecstasy](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HxggbGGL_GM/VlVloZmYfpI/AAAAAAAABCU/vznikJ2Tzro/s1600/ecstasy.jpg "Ecstasy")
Swapnil loves to ride swings at the local park, he feels ecstatic on riding one! However, the park plot is recently being used up for the construction of a public building. Swapnil had been depressed, until his mother decided to put up a swing right beside their home!
Swapnil’s mom Swagata is now faced with a new problem. She has decided on the position of the swing in her yard, but height of the swing needs critical calculation.
Swagata has picked point A (directly downward from the hanging point) in her yard such that A has a perpendicular distance of d meters from the foot of their house. His feet need clearance of x meters above the ground, and y meters away from the building. Swapnil can keep balance while riding the swing if the swinging angle does not exceed theta-degrees. Your task is to calculate the maximum height h of Swapnil’s swing.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input file contains multiple test cases. Each test case begins with a line containing three positive floating-point numbers- **d, x** and **y** **(0<x,y<d<100)** in meters. Next line of test case contains another floating point number, which is the maximum swinging angle theta in degrees **(0<theta<180)**. It is guaranteed that all test cases will have a valid answer.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each sample input, output the maximum height h of the swing in meters with exactly two digits after decimal point.</div>
