<h1>CHASE1 - Chase</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Chase is a two-person board game. A board consists of squares numbered from 1 to _n_. For each pair of different squares it is known if they are adjacent to one another or they are not. Each player has a piece at his disposal. At the beginning of a game pieces of players are placed on fixed, distinct squares. In one turn a player can leave his piece on the square it stands or move it to an adjacent square.
A game board has the following properties:
- it contains no triangles, i.e. there are no three distinct squares such that each pair of them is adjacent,
- each square can be reached by each player.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The number of test cases _t_ is in the first line of input, then _t_ test cases follow separated by an empty line.
In the first line of a test case there are four integers _n_, _m_, _a_ and _b_ separated by single spaces, where 2 <= _n_ <= 3000, _n_-1 <= _m_ <= 15000, 1 <= _a_, _b_ <= _n_. These are (respectively): the number of squares of the board, the number of adjacent (unordered) pairs, the number of the square on which the piece of player A is placed, the number of the square on which the piece of player B is placed. In each of the following lines there are two distinct positive integers separated by a single space, which denote numbers of adjacent squares.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case you should output one line containing:
- one word "No", if player B cannot catch player A, or
- one integer - the number of turns needed by B to catch A (if B can catch A).</div>
