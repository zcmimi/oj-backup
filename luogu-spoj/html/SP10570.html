<h1>LONGCS - Longest Common Substring</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有T（1 ≤ T ≤ 20）组数据，每组数据包含K (1 ≤ K ≤ 10)个小写字母字符串。
要求对每一组字符串输出其最长公共子串长度。每一个字符串长度<= 10^4。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Substrings are consecutive parts of a string. A problem usually solved with dynamic programming is to find the longest common substring problem is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a substring (or are substrings) of two strings.
Your task is to find the length of the longest common substring of K strings.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required sequence, with a blank space between consecutive terms. It is guaranteed that all terms in the sequence are integers.</div>
