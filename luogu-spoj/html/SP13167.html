<h1>TIP3 - Totient in permutation (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In number theory, Euler's totient (or PHI function), is an arithmetic function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to a positive integer N that are relatively prime to this number N.
That is, if N is a positive integer, then PHI(N) is the number of integers K for which GCD(N, K) = 1 and 1
Interestingly, PHI(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There is only one number M.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For the given M, you have to print on a single line the value of N, for which 1 < N < M, PHI(N) is a permutation of N and the ratio N/PHI(N) produces a minimum. If there's several answers output the greatest, or if need, "No solution." without quotes. Leading zeros are not allowed for integers greater than 0.</div>
