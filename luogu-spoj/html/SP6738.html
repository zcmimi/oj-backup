<h1>CHEFMAY - Nice Quadrangles</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are n points with integer coordinates. We can form different quadrangles out of them by taking four different points and connecting them with lines. Let’s call a quadrangle ABCD nice if and only if:
- Ax > 0 and Ay > 0;
- Bx > 0 and By < 0;
- Cx < 0 and Cy < 0;
- Dx < 0 and Dy > 0;
- ABCD has an integer area.
Your task is to count all different nice quadrangles that can be formed on the given points.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input file contains number t – the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows. The first line of each test case contains number n – the number of points. Then n lines follow each consisting of two integers x, y – the coordinates of a point. No two points in the same test case coincide.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print the number of nice quadrangles that can be formed using given points.</div>
