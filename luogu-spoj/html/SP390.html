<h1>BILLIARD - Billiard</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述：
有一宽a英寸，长b英寸的台球桌。一球从台球桌中间出发，在s(＞0)秒之后，球返回到它出发的点，且 m次从长边反弹，n次从桌子的宽反弹。找到发射角A（从水平方向测量）//与宽同一方向//，A将在0到90度之间，及球的初始速度。
假设与侧的碰撞是弹性的（没有能量损失），因此平行于各侧的球的速度分量保持不变。同样，假设球的半径为零。记住，台球桌上没有口袋。//其实原文是两种台球桌Remember that, unlike pool tables, billiard tables have no pockets.~~只是翻译时，傻傻分不不清楚。~~//
------------
#### 输入格式：
输入有很多行，每行分别是a,b,s,m,和,n（所有数都是不大于10000的正整数）。五个0结束输入。
#### 输出格式
除最后一行，每行输入对应一行输出。每行为空格隔开的两实数（保留两位小数）第一个数是角度A，第二个是根据上面的描述，以每秒英寸的速度测量球的速度。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In a billiard table with horizontal side **a** inches and vertical side **b** inches, a ball is launched from the middle of the table. After **s** > 0 seconds the ball returns to the point from which it was launched, after having made **m** bounces off the vertical sides and **n** bounces off the horizontal sides of the table. Find the launching angle **A** (measured from the horizontal), which will be between 0 and 90 degrees inclusive, and the initial velocity of the ball.
Assume that the collisions with a side are elastic (no energy loss), and thus the velocity component of the ball parallel to each side remains unchanged. Also, assume the ball has a radius of zero. Remember that, unlike pool tables, billiard tables have no pockets.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of a sequence of lines, each containing five nonnegative integers separated by whitespace. The five numbers are: **a**, **b**, **s**, **m**, and **n**, respectively. All numbers are positive integers not greater than 10000.
Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input line except the last, output a line containing two real numbers (accurate to two decimal places) separated by a single space. The first number is the measure of the angle **A** in degrees and the second is the velocity of the ball measured in inches per second, according to the description above.</div>
