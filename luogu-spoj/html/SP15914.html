<h1>USUBQSUB - Update Sub-Matrix &amp; Query Sub-Matrix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Updating and querying 1 dimensional arrays is a popular question. How about updating and quering sub-matrices of a matrix?
A sub-matrix will be depicted as (a, b), (c, d). This implies that it will include all the cells (x, y) such that a<=x<=c and b<=y<=d.
The matrix is indexed from \[1..N\]\[1..N\], where N is the size.
You are given a matrix of size NxN, with each element initially set to 0. There are M queries and each query can be of one of the two types:
1 x1 y1 x2 y2: This query asks you to return the sum of all the elements in the sub-matrix (x1, y1), (x2, y2).
2 x1 y1 x2 y2 K: This query asks you to add K to each element in the sub-matrix (x1, y1), (x2, y2).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains N, M.
The next M lines contain queries in the same forms as stated above.
You may assume that x1<=x2 and y1<=y2 for all queries.
Also N<=1000 and M<=10 $ ^{5} $ . K<=10 $ ^{9} $</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The answer to all the queries wherein you need to return the sum of elements in the sub-matrix, i.e., all the queries of type 1.</div>
