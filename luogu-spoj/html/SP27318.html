<h1>VECTAR8 - Primal Fear</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Changu and Mangu are afraid of prime numbers, but they are not afraid of all prime numbers. They were afraid of only a special kind of prime numbers. They are afraid of the prime numbers (without the digit zero, they love all the primes which have digits 0 in them) that remain prime no matter how many of the leading digits are omitted. For example, they are afraid of 4632647 because it doesn't have the digit 0 and each of its truncations (632647, 32647, 2647, 647, 47, and 7) are primes.
You are given a simple task, given a number of N, find out the number of primes not greater that N, that changu and mangu are afraid of.</div>
