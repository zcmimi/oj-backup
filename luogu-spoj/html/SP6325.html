<h1>NGON - Many polygons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is a regular n-gon. We mark some points on its sides: a1 points on the first side, a2 on the second ... an on the last. Marked points do not coincide with the vertices n-gon. The question is, how many different convex nondegenerate (n-1)-gons you can build, using marked points as vertices?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the number t - the number of tests. Next comes the description of t tests. Each test consists of two lines. The first line of the test contains an integer n - number of vertices of original n-gon. Second line of the test lists n integers a1, a2, ..., an - number of points marked on each side.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test, print out the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007.</div>
