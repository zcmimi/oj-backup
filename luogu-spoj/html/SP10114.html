<h1>RMTLAND - Remoteland</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their independence day every year. However, as it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (_D_) is a perfect square, and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less than or equal to _n_.
As the years in Remoteland have 1,000,000,007 days, their citizens just need _D_ modulo 1,000,000,007. Note that they are interested in the largest _D_, not in the largest _D_ modulo 1,000,000,007.
**Input**
Every test case is described by a single line with an integer _n_, (1 n
**Output**
For each test case, output the number of days ago the Republic became independent, modulo 1,000,000,007, one per line.
**Sample Input**
```
<pre class="verbatim">4
9348095
6297540
0
```
  
  
**Sample Output**

 ```
<pre class="verbatim">4
177582252
644064736
```
