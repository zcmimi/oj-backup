<h1>MATPROD - Symmetric matrix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**\[NOTE: A harder version of this problem is [Symmetric Matrix 2](../MATPROD2/ "Symmetric Matrix 2"); you may want to try it once you solve this one.\]**
You are given an **N** x **N** matrix **m $ _{ij} $** such that **m $ _{ij} $ == m $ _{ji} $** for **i, j = 1, ..., N**. We would like to compute the value of
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP19684/793d3fefd400ef9230d61cfe96c878f0c353bde6.png)
Note that in the above expression we are going over **K** indices **i $ _{1} $ , ..., i $ _{K} $** that run over the values **1, ..., N**, while summing over the product of all the **K\*(K-1)/2** possible matrix elements that we can form with these indices.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains two integers **N** and **K** (**2 and **2 ), representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix **m $ _{ij} $** and the number of sums in the formula above, respectively. The following **N** lines contain **N** integers each, being the **j**-th number in the **i**-th line the value of ****m** $ _{ij} $** (**-10 and **m $ _{ij} $ == m $ _{ji} $** for **i, j = 1, ..., N**).******</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single line with the result of the calculation. Because this number can be very big, output its remainder modulo division by **1000000007** (**== 10 $ ^{9} $ +7**).</div>
