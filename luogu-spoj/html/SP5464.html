<h1>CT - Counting triangles</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>考虑一个左下角(0,0)右上角(X, Y)为二维整数网格，我们感兴趣的是网格节点(整数坐标)上所有三个角的等腰直角三角形。你的任务是数那些三角形的数目。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Consider a 2D integer grid with lower left corner at (0, 0) and upper right corner at (X, Y). We are interested in isosceles right triangles which all the 3 corners at the grid node (integer coordinates). Your task is to count the number of those triangles.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
