<h1>FACTMULP - Product of factorials (hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For **_n_** positive integer, let **_F(n) = 1! × 2! × 3! × 4! × ... × n!_**, product of factorial(i) for i in \[1..n\], For **_p_** a prime number, and **_n_** an integer, and let **_V(p, n) = max({i>=0 integer, such that p^i divides F(n)})_**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains an integer **_T_**, the number of test cases. On each of the next **_T_** lines, your are given two integers **_p_** a prime number, and **_e_**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you have to print **_V(p, p^e)_**. As the answer may not fit in a 64-bit container, just output your answer modulo 10^9+7.</div>
