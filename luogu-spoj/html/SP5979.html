<h1>YAPP - Yet Another Permutations Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>How many permutations of the first N numbers exist such that the maximum element between the indices \[i..j\] is either present at index i, or at index j ?
**Input**
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N
**Output**
Output T lines containing the required answer for the corresponding test case. Since the answers can get really big, output the result modulo 1000000007.
**Example**
```
Sample Input:
1
2
Sample Output:
2
```
**Constraints**
1 <= T <= 10000
1 <= N <= 1000000000</div>
