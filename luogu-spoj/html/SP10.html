题目描述
ACM最重要的活动是GSM网络。作为移动电话运营商，ACM必须建立自己的发射站。计算电磁波的准确行为是非常重要的。不幸的是，电磁场的预测是一项非常复杂的任务，描述它们的公式非常长，很难读懂。例如，描述电气工程基本规律的麦克斯韦方程是非常困难的。
ACM设计了自己的计算机系统，可以进行一些现场计算，并以数学表达式的形式产生结果。不幸的是，通过在几个步骤中生成表达式，表达式中总是有一些不需要的括号。您的任务是通过删除所有不必要的括号来获取这些部分结果，并使它们“良好”。
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入的第一行有一个正整数T（约等于10000）。它代表后面的表达式数量。每个表达式由一个单独的行组成，该行只包含小写字母、运算符（+、-、*、）和括号（和）。字母是可以有任何值的变量，运算符和括号有它们通常的含义。乘法和除法优先于减法和加法。所有具有相同优先级的操作都是从左到右计算的（操作符是左关联的）。表达式中没有空格。没有一个输入行包含250个以上的字符。
输出格式
为每个表达式输出一行。每行必须包含相同的表达式，并删除不需要的括号。您必须删除尽可能多的括号，而不改变表达式的语义。只有在以下条件中的任何一个条件下，该表达式的语义才被认为是相同的：
行动的顺序保持不变。这意味着“(a+b)+c"与"a+b+c"相同，"a+(b/c)"与"a+b/c"相同。
一些操作的顺序被交换了，但是对于加法和乘法的结合性，结果保持不变。这意味着"a+(b+c)"和"(a+b)+c"是相同的。如果减法或除法是第二种运算，我们也可以把加法和减法结合起来，把乘法和除法结合起来。例如，"a+(b-c)"与"a+b-c"相同。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> The most important activity of ACM is the GSM network. As the mobile phone operator, ACM must build its own transmitting stations. It is very important to compute the exact behaviour of electro-magnetic waves. Unfortunately, prediction of electro-magnetic fields is a very complex task and the formulas describing them are very long and hard-to-read. For example, Maxwell's Equations describing the basic laws of electrical engineering are really tough.
ACM has designed its own computer system that can make some field computations and produce results in the form of mathematic expressions. Unfortunately, by generating the expression in several steps, there are always some unneeded parentheses inside the expression. Your task is to take these partial results and make them "nice" by removing all unnecessary parentheses.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 10000). It stands for the number of expressions to follow. Each expression consists of a single line containing only lowercase letters, operators (+, -, \*, /) and parentheses (( and )). The letters are variables that can have any value, operators and parentheses have their usual meaning. Multiplication and division have higher priority then subtraction and addition. All operations with the same priority are computed from left to right (operators are left-associative). There are no spaces inside the expressions. No input line contains more than 250 characters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Print a single line for every expression. The line must contain the same expression with unneeded parentheses removed. You must remove as many parentheses as possible without changing the semantics of the expression. The semantics of the expression is considered the same if and only if any of the following conditions hold:
- The ordering of operations remains the same. That means "(a+b)+c" is the same as "a+b+c", and "a+(b/c)" is the same as "a+b/c".
- The order of some operations is swapped but the result remains unchanged with respect to the addition and multiplication associativity. That means "a+(b+c)" and "(a+b)+c" are the same. We can also combine addition with subtraction and multiplication with division, if the subtraction or division is the second operation. For example, "a+(b-c)" is the same as "a+b-c".
You cannot use any other laws, namely you cannot swap left and right operands and you cannot replace "a-(b-c)" with "a-b+c".</div>
