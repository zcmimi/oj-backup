<h1>ADACYCLE - Ada and Cycle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug is on a trip in Bugindia. There are many cities and some uni-directional roads connecting them. Ada is wondering about the shortest path, which begins in a city and ends in the same city. Since Ada likes short trips, she asked you to find the length of such path for each city in Bugindia.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line will contain **0 < N , the number of cities.**
Then **N** lines follow, each containing **N** integers **0 . One means, that there is a road between **i** and **j** (zero means there isn't a road).**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print **N** lines, the length of shortest path which begins in city **i** and ends in city **i**. If the path doesn't exist, print "**NO WAY**" instead.</div>
