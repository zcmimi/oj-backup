<h1>TILING - Rectangle Tiling</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We say that a 2-dimensional, rectangular word w of size n×m (imagine it as a board with letter written in the squares) can be tiled with a rectangular pattern p if there are such occurrences of p in w (but not necessarily all of them) that no two of them overlap and each symbol (square) of w is covered by one of them. Given such word w, find a rectangular pattern p of smallest size (area) which the word w can be tiled with.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
