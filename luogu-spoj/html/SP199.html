<h1>EMPTY - Empty Cuboids</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> We call a cuboid **regular** if:
- one of its vertices is a point with coordinates (0,0,0),
- edges beginning in this vertex lie on the positive semi-axes of the coordinate system,
- the edges are not longer than 10 $ ^{6} $
There is given a set **A** of points of space, whose coordinates are integers from the interval \[1..10 $ ^{6} $ \]. We try to find a regular cuboid of maximal volume which does not contain any of the points from the set **A**. A point belongs to the cuboid if it belongs to the interior of the cuboid, i.e. it is a point of the cuboid, but not of its wall.
### Task
Write a program which:
- reads from the standard input the coordinates of points from the set **A**,
- finds one of the regular cuboids of maximal volume which does not contain any points from the set **A**,
- writes the result to standard output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input begins with a line containing integer t<=10, the number of test cases. t test cases follow.
In the first line of each test case one non-negative integer _n_ is written ( _n_ <= _5000_). It is the number of elements in the set **A**. In the following _n_ lines of the input there are triples of integers from the interval \[1..10 $ ^{6} $ \], which are the X, Y and Z coordinates of points from **A**, repectively. Numbers in each line are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case there should be three integers separated by single spaces. These are the X, Y and Z coordinates (respectively) of the vertex of the regular cuboid of maximal volume. If there is more than one such a cuboid, choose whichever. We require that all coordinates be positive.</div>
