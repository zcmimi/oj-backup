<h1>OHANISER - Ohani And The Series</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Now a days, Ohani has become very expert in mathematics. Her teachers like her very much because of her excellent performance.
One day, one of her teacher gave her a problem to solve. He will give Ohani a number N. This will represent a table of N rows. The first row contains number from 1 to N. Then the next line will contain N-1 numbers, In the second row, the first number will be the summation of the first two numbers (1 + 2) of the previous row, the second number will be the summation of the second two numbers (2 + 3) of the previous row and so on. Row 3 will have N-2 numbers with same procedures. Same procedure follows for row 4, row 5, .... , row N. On the last row, there will be only a single number. Ohani has to tell that only number of the Nth row.
For example: If N = 4, then the table is:
1 2 3 4
3 5 7
8 12
20
So Ohani has to answer the last remaining number: 20.
She can answer when N is small, but can't when N is large. Can you help her?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the number of testcases T (T <= 100000).
Each of the test cases contain a number N where 1 <= N <= 100000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You have to output the case number and the required answer. As the number can be very large, output the answer modulo 1000000007.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2\n1\n2</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Case 1: 1\nCase 2: 3</code></pre>
