<h1>ODDDIV - Odd Numbers of Divisors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a positive odd integer K and two positive integers low and high, determine how many integers between low and high contain exactly K divisors.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains a positive integer C (0 < C < 100,000), the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of a line containing three integers: K, low, and high (1 < K < 10000, 0 < low</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output for each case consists of one line: the number of integers between low and high, inclusive, that contain exactly K divisors.</div>
