<h1>BSMATH1 - Math with Bases (Easy)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Ben had just learned different bases in math. He learned very quickly how to add and subtract in multiple bases, so his teacher provided him with a worksheet to work on. Each section provided a different base and gave an example.
Unfortunately, Little Ben's teacher forgot to write what base each question was in! Please help Little Ben do his homework; he'll be very grateful!
**Input**
The first line of input contains an integer `n` (1
```
A - B = C
I
X1 op Y1 =
X2 op Y2 =
...
XI op YI =
```
where `A - B = C` is the correct example, `I` (1 Xi and `Yi` are the operands of each problem (`Xi` = |`Xi`|, `Yi` = |`Yi`|), and `op` is either + or -, denoting addition or subtraction.
**Output**
Your program should output in the following format:
```
SECTION 1 (BASE b)
X1 op Y1 = Z1
X2 op Y2 = Z2
...
Xi op Yi = Zi
SECTION 2 (BASE b)
X1 op Y1 = Z1
X2 op Y2 = Z2
...
Xi op Yi = Zi
...
SECTION N (BASE b)
X1 op Y1 = Z1
X2 op Y2 = Z2
...
Xi op Yi = Zi
```
where `Zi` is the solution to `Xi op Yi`, and `b` is the base used. (2 If the base is ambiguous, use the smallest base for which the example is correct and the questions are valid. You may assume all solutions fit inside a 64-bit integer and that each base will appear at most once.
**Example**
**Input:**
```
4
110 - 101 = 1
2
1111111 + 1 =
100 - 1 =
177 + 1 = 200
2
7712347 + 7 =
11111 + 7777 =
ZAP + DZ = ZOO
1
E + PI =
10 + 1 = 11
1
5 + 5 =
```
**Output:**
```
SECTION 1 (BASE 2)
1111111 + 1 = 10000000
100 - 1 = 11
SECTION 2 (BASE 8)
7712347 + 7 = 7712356
11111 + 7777 = 21110
SECTION 3 (BASE 36)
E + PI = PW
SECTION 4 (BASE 6)
5 + 5 = 14
```
**Notes:**
- large input/output data, be careful with certain languages
- Tricky input/output; please read problem statement carefully</div>
