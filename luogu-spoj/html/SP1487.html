<h1>PT07J - Query on a tree III</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你被给定一棵带点权的n个点的有根数，点从1到n编号。
定义查询 query(x,k): 寻找以x为根的k大点的编号（从小到大排序第k个点）
假设没有两个相同的点权。
输入格式： 第一行为整数n，第二行为点权，接下来n-1行为树边，接下来一行为整数m，下面m行为两个整数x,k，代表query(x,k)
输出格式： m行，输出每次查询的结果。
Translated by @vegacx </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given a node-labeled rooted tree with _n_ nodes.
Define the query (_x_, _k_): Find the node whose label is _k_-th largest in the subtree of the node _x_. Assume no two nodes have the same labels.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line contains one integer _n_ (1 <= _n_ <= 10 $ ^{5} $ ). The next line contains _n_ integers _l $ _{i} $_ (0 <= _l $ _{i} $_ <= 10 $ ^{9} $ ) which denotes the label of the _i_-th node.
Each line of the following _n_ - 1 lines contains two integers _u_, _v_. They denote there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_. Node 1 is the root of the tree.
The next line contains one integer _m_ (1 <= _m_ <= 10 $ ^{4} $ ) which denotes the number of the queries. Each line of the next _m_ contains two integers _x_, _k_. (_k_ <= the total node number in the subtree of _x_)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query (_x_, _k_), output the index of the node whose label is the _k_-th largest in the subtree of the node _x_.</div>
