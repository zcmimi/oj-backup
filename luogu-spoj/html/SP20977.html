<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Traveling by car can sometimes be very boring. The natural cure for this boredom is to play a word</div>

<br />
<div>The first line of input contains two positive integers (N 5000) and (M 10000), the number of words
in the dictionary and the number of license plates to be handled. Each of the following N lines contains
a word from the dictionary, a string no more than 100 characters long containing only lower case letters
from the English alphabet. This is followed by M lines each containing a string of three uppercase letters
from the English alphabet, representing a license plate.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each license plate in the input you should output one line containing either the first valid word in
the dictionary or the sentence "No valid word" if no such word exists.</div>
