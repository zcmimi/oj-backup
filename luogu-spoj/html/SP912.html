<h1>MATRIX2 - Submatrix of submatrix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a matrix P of N rows and M columns. It consists of integer numbers in the range \[1..100\]. We define the sum of a matrix is the sum of its elements. Your task is to find a submatrix Q (of A rows and B columns) of P and a submatrix K (of C rows and D columns) of Q so that the difference between the sum of Q and the sum of K is maximal, and submatrix K is absolutely inside matrix Q (i.e no element on matrix Q's sides is also in matrix K).
Because the tests are large, we suggest a method to define matrix P:
P\[i\]\[j\] = ( P\[i\]\[j-1\] \* 71 + 17 ) mod 100 + 1 . ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N , 1 ≤ j ≤ M )
With this method we only care about P\[i\]\[1\].
**Constraints**
1 ≤ N , M ≤ 1000
1 ≤ A ≤ N
1 ≤ B ≤ M
0 ≤ C ≤ A - 2
0 ≤ D ≤ B - 2</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10 ), equal to the number of testcases. Then descriptions of t testcases follow. The first line of the description contains 6 integer numbers N, M, A, B, C, D. Then N lines follow, line i contains one integer number P\[i\]\[1\].</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, your program should output the maximal difference between two matrices (in a separate line).</div>
