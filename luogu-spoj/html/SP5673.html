<h1>NG1FRCTN - Fractions on Tree ( reloaded !)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A fraction tree is an infinite binary tree defined as follows:
1)Every node of tree contains a fraction
2)Root of tree contains the fraction 1/1
3)Any node with fraction i/j has two children : left child with fraction i/(i+j) and right child with fraction (i+j)/j
For example , fraction tree upto 3 levels is as shown:
### ![Fraction tree upto 3 levels](http://www.mathlesstraveled.com/custom/images/cw-small.png "Fraction tree upto 3 levels")
We number the nodes according to increasing levels ( root is at level 1) and at any same level , nodes are numbered from left to right. So first node holds the fraction 1/1 , second one holds 1/2 , third one holds 2/1 fourth one holds 1/3 and so on.
Your task is simple, as always !. Given two numbers a and b , you are to find the product of fractions at all those nodes whose number is between a and b both inclusive.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Every line of the input contains two numbers a and b seperated by a space. You are to find the product of all fractions which are at node having number between a and b both inclusive. Input file terminates with a 0 0 which is not to be processed.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input , print numerator and denominator of the lowest form of the fraction seperated by a /. Output of each case to be done in seperate lines.</div>
