<h1>BIGSEQ - Sequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given the sequence of all K-digit binary numbers: 0, 1,..., 2 $ ^{K} $ -1. You need to fully partition the sequence into M chunks. Each chunk must be a consecutive subsequence of the original sequence. Let S $ _{i} $ (1 ≤ i ≤ M) be the total number of 1's in all numbers in the ith chunk when written in binary, and let S be the maximum of all S $ _{i} $ , i.e. the maximum number of 1's in any chunk. Your goal is to minimize S.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of input, two numbers, K and M (1 ≤ K ≤ 100, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100, M ≤ 2^K), are given, separated by a single space character.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In one line of the output, write the minimum S that can be obtained by some split. Write it without leading zeros. The result is not guaranteed to fit in a 64-bit integer.</div>
