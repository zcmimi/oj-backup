<h1>ENCONDIN - Run Length Encoding</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Your task is to write a program that performs a simple form of run-length encoding, as described by the rules below.
Any sequence of between 2 to 9 identical characters is encoded by two characters. The first character is the length of the sequence, represented by one of the characters `2` through `9`. The second character is the value of the repeated character. A sequence of more than 9 identical characters is dealt with by first encoding 9 characters, then the remaining ones.
Any sequence of characters that does not contain consecutive repetitions of any characters is represented by a `1` character followed by the sequence of characters, terminated with another `1`. If a `1` appears as part of the sequence, it is escaped with a `1`, thus two `1` characters are output.</div>
