<h1>EMTY3 - Can You Make It Empty 3</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let us introduce an algorithm with a function **CanEmpty()** which takes a string P as a parameter and return **TRUE** if it is possible to make P empty, otherwise return **FALSE**.
String P consists of only 0 and 1. The pseudo-code implementation of **CanEmpty()** function is as follows.
bool **CanEmpty(**String P**)**
{
while(P has at least one substring 100)
{
Chose any one substring 100 in P and delete it.
}
if(P is empty) return **TRUE**;
else return **FALSE**;
}
Now you are given a string S consisting of 0 and 1, you have to find the length of longest substring of **S** that can be made empty applying **CanEmpty()** algorithm.
As for example, let S=101**110000**0**100**
S has only two sub-strings (bold) which can be made empty applying **CanEmpty()** algorithm.
The first substring will have the delete- sequence in **CanEmpty()** function :
110000->100->empty
The second substring will have the delete-sequence in **CanEmpty()** function:
100->empty
**The length of first substring is 6 and second is 3. So, the required answer is 6.**
**Input**
Input starts with an integer **T (, denoting the number of test cases.**
Each case contains a string S. The size of string is at most **200000**.
**Output**
For each test case, print the case number and required answer.
**Sample Input**
**Output for Sample Input**
2
1011100000100
111011
Case 1: 6
Case 2: 0
