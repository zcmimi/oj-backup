<h1>KNMD - Subsequences with modulo</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given sequence _A $ _{1} $ , A $ _{2} $ , ... A $ _{n} $_ and integer _k_. For each integer _i_ _(0 find such **nonempty** subsequence of _A_ so that sum of numbers in this subsequence is maximal possible and remainder of integer division of this sum by _k_ is equal to _i_._</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In first line numbers _n_ and _k (1 ._
In second line: _n_ numbers representing sequence _A (1 ._</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print _k_ numbers in one line. _i_'th number represent sum of numbers in subsequence for number _i - 1_. If there is no such subsequence print -1.</div>
