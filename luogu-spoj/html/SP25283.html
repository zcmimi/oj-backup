There are N-counters available and each counter has a specified number of chicken nuggets.
The cost of each nugget being bought at any counter is same as the number of nuggets that are still remaining at the counter at that point of time( Inclusive of the nugget being bought ).
Pre wants to have M nuggets. As usual Buddy accepts to sponsor Pre with all his pocket money. He is so innocent that he obeys each and every order of Pre with no second thought. Pre being cunning wants Buddy to spend her too much money. So she directs buddy to buy nuggets at the counters which she says, so that he spends maximum money for her.
Ofcourse you can't help Buddy :( But try to find him how much he would spend for Pre, if he obeys her like an IDIOT.</div>
