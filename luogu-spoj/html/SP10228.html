<h1>AMR11A - Magic Grid</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>非常感谢帮助哈利波特在10月份找到了巫师的不朽之石。我们没有告诉你它只是一个在线游戏吗？唔！现在这里是哈利真正的现场任务。您将获得一个具有R行和C列的magrid S（魔术网格）。这个大杂烩的每个细胞都有一个我们勇敢的英雄必须击败的匈牙利恐龙，或者是他的老师斯内普为他留下的一瓶魔法药水。单元格中的龙（i，j）带走| S [i] [j] | 他的力量点，一个细胞（i，j）的魔药增加了哈利的力量S [i] [j]。如果他的旅程中任何时候他的力量下降到0或更低，Harry就会死去，没有任何神奇的石头可以让他复活。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Thanks a lot for helping Harry Potter in finding the Sorcerer's Stone of Immortality in October. Did we not tell you that it was just an online game ? uhhh! now here is the real onsite task for Harry. You are given a magrid S ( a magic grid ) having R rows and C columns. Each cell in this magrid has either a Hungarian horntail dragon that our intrepid hero has to defeat, or a flask of magic potion that his teacher Snape has left for him. A dragon at a cell (i,j) takes away |S\[i\]\[j\]| strength points from him, and a potion at a cell (i,j) increases Harry's strength by S\[i\]\[j\]. If his strength drops to 0 or less at any point during his journey, Harry dies, and no magical stone can revive him.</div>
