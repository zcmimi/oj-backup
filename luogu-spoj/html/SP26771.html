<h1>KPRIMESB - Almost Prime Numbers Again</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Almost Prime Numbers are composite numbers which are not divisible by certain prime numbers. Given K prime numbers and an integer N, find out the number of Almost Prime Numbers (ie. composite numbers not divisible by any of the given K prime numbers) that are not greater than N.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input consists of an integer **T (1<=T<=1000)**, denoting the number of test cases. Then **T** test cases follow. Each case begins with a line containing two integers **N (0<=N<=10^6)** and **K (1<=K<=10)**. The next line contains **K** space separated prime numbers. All the prime numbers are guaranteed to be **less than 50**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single line in the format **Case X: Y**, where **X** denotes the test case number and **Y** denotes the number of Almost Prime Numbers that are not greater than N.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
