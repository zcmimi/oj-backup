<h1>BTCODE_K - Array Sorting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sumit specialises in sorting algorithms, and Abhishek decides to test Sumit's coding skills. An array of 'n' numbers a\[0\], a\[1\], a\[2\], ..., a\[n-1\] is given. Abhishek gives a sequence of inputs of the form "v i j". Each input is either a query or an update (query if 'v' is 0, update otherwise).
For any input of the form "0 i j" ,Sumit's output should be as follows:
If the subarray a\[i\], a\[i+1\], ... a\[j\] is unsorted, output 0.
If the subarray a\[i\], a\[i+1\], ... a\[j\] is sorted in non-descending order, output 1.
If the subarray a\[i\], a\[i+1\], ... a\[j\] is sorted in non-ascending order, output 2.
If the subarray a\[i\], a\[i+1\], ... a\[j\] is sorted in both non-ascending and non-descending order (i.e, if all the elements in the range are equal), output 3.
Any other input "v i j" (v!=0) should be treated as an update, as follows:
For each element in the subarray a\[i\], a\[i+1\], ... a\[j\], Sumit has to replace the element a\[k\] with v-a\[k\].
Sumit is really tired and does not want to write a program. Can you write a program for Sumit, which responds to Abhishek's instructions?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains 2 space separated integers 'n' and 'q'. The second line contains 'n' integers a\[0\], a\[1\], ....., a\[n-1\]. Each of the next 'q' lines contain 3 integers 'v', 'i', 'j'.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query, output a single integer 0, 1, 2 or 3, denoting the answer.</div>
