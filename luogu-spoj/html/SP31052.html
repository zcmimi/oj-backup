<h1>PLAYGAME - PLAYGAME</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题意：多组测试数据，每组一个整数n代表硬币个数。Hemlata先取硬币，每次取1,2或5个硬币，谁不能取就赢了，问最后谁赢了，输出他的名字。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Hemlata and Ragini were playing a game from a number of coins. Hemlata was jealous of Ragini. She wanted to win at all cost. A stack consists of **n** coins. Any player can take either 1, 2 or 5 (anyone number of coins) coins from stack at a time. Both Hemlata and Ragini play their moves alternatively.
Hemlata always starts first. Both play optimally. Your job is to predict the output beforehand. A player who can't take any coin loses the game. A player can take only one of 1, 2, 5 number of coins at a time in a move.</div>

<br />
<div>First line contains number of testcases **t**. 0 < **t** <= 10^5

<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each testcase printf "Hemlata" if Hemlata wins, else print "Ragini" if Ragini wins (without quotes) in different lines .</div>
