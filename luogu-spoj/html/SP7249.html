<div>The first line contains T <= 100, the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer (1 <= N <= 200), the number of mixtures the shop already has. The next N lines each contain two floating point numbers (0 <= A, B <= 100, A+B <= 100) representing the percentages of components A and B in each mixture. The next line contains an integer (1 <= Q <= 5151) the number of mixtures to verify. The next Q lines each contain two floating point numbers (0 <= A, B <= 100, A+B <= 100) representing the percentages of components A and B in each new mixture. Test cases are separated by one or more empty lines.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each mixture query print "Yes" if the new mixture can be created from the already existent ones or "No" otherwise. Print a blank line between test cases.</div>
