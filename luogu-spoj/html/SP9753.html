<h1>TUPLEDIV - Tuple Division</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Description**
You are given N tuples with M dimensions. You need to choose some tuples and divide them into M groups. Each tuple can be used for only once and the size of the i $ ^{th} $ group is C $ _{i} $ . We define the score of the i $ ^{th} $ group is the sum of value in the i $ ^{th} $ dimension of the tuples in the i $ ^{th} $ group. Your target is to firstly maximize the score of 1 $ ^{th} $ group, then maximize the score 2 $ ^{th} $ group and so on.
**Input**
The first line of the input contains an integer T(T
**Output**
For each test case, print one line with M score of some optimal division.
**Sample Input**
2
4 2
2 1
3 2
2 1
2 2
1 1
4 3
1 1 2
8 7 1
8 7 2
8 7 4
8 2 3
**Sample Output**
5 2
8 7 7
**Hint**
In case 2, we can dive the group like:
Group 1: (8, 7, 2) score = 8
Group 2: (8, 7, 1) score = 7
Group 3: (8, 7, 4), (8, 2, 3) score = 4 + 3 = 7</div>
