<h1>SEQFUN - Sequence Function</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We define a sequence {x}: {x}={x\_0, x\_1, … , x\_n-1 } where x\_i is a interger.
We have a function f: {x}->{x’} where {x} is a finite sequence.
After we have a finite sequence {x}, we can get f({x}) follow these rules :
(1). Remove all 0 in x : a 0 b 0 c d 0 e f 0 g => a b c d e f g
(2). Turn 1 into 100 and -1 into -100 : a 1 b 1 -1 c d e f g => a 100 b 100 -100 c d e f g
(3). Add all 2^k (k>1) at the end of the sequence : a 2 b 8 c d e 1024 f g => a 2 b 8 c d e 1024 f g 2 8 1024
(4). Add any positive odd prime x at the end of the sequence x-1 times: a 3 b c 7 d e f 5 g => a 3 b c 7 d e f 5 g 3 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 5 5 5
(5). For any positive composite number (not 2^k, k>1 ), we just keep it once: a 6 b 6 c d 6 e 4 4 f g => a 6 b c d e 4 4 f g
(6). Keep any t (t<-1) in the sequence.
For a example:
{x}={-5 1 0 2 9 16 7 5 3 2 9 9 -1}
f({x})={-5 100 2 9 16 7 5 3 2 -100 2 2 16 7 7 7 7 7 7 5 5 5 5 3 3}
We define g({x}) is the sum of all the element in sequence x.
We define h({x}) = g(f({x}))-g({x}).
A consecutive sequence of x is a sequence {x\_i, x\_i+1, x\_i+2, … , x\_j} where 0<=i<=j<n. Now I will give you a sequence {x} . I want to ask you the maximal h({y}) where {y} is a consecutive sequence of {x}.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
