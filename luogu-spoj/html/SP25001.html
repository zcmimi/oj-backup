<h1>CS345A1 - Red Blue Line Segments</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are n vertical line segments colored red and there are n horizontal line segments colored blue.
We wish to find the number of red-blue pairs of intersecting segments.
![Red Blue segments in a unit square](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sshekh/spoj/red_blue.png "Red Blue segments in a unit square")
These line segments are inside a unit square. Each blue segment is created by generating 3 random numbers (x\_1, x\_2, y) in the interval \[0, 1\]. These 3 numbers represent the segment joining (x\_1, y) and (x\_2, y). Red segments are generated similarly.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains the number of segments n (n <= 100000)
next n lines define the blue segments. Each line contains 3 floating point numbers (in \[0, 1\]) x\_1 x\_2 y representing the segment joining (x\_1, y) and (x\_2, y).
next n lines define the red segments. Each line contains 3 floating point numbers (in \[0, 1\]) y\_1 y\_2 x representing the segment joining (x, y\_1) and (x, y\_2).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single line containing the number of intersections.
_Note: Toucing line segments also count as intersecting. For ex - blue segment joining (0.1, 0.2) and (0.3, 0.2) intersects with red segment joining (0.3, 0.4) and (0.3, 0.2)._</div>
