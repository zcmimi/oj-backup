<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有n个人，他们之间有至多（n-1）对双向朋友关系，即朋友关系构成一个森林。现在要安排他们坐成一排，使任意相邻两人为朋友，不是朋友的两人座位中间必须有一张空出的椅子。求最少需要几张椅子。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Dr. Baws has an interesting problem. His $ N $ graduate students, while friendly with some select people, are generally not friendly with each other. No graduate student is willing to sit beside a person they aren't friends with.

The desks are up against the wall, in a single line, so it's possible that Dr. Baws will have to leave some desks empty. He does know which students are friends, and fortunately the list is not so long: it turns out that for any subset of $ K $ graduate students, there are at most $ K-1 $ pairs of friends. Dr. Baws would like you to minimize the total number of desks required. What is this minimum number?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input begins with an integer $ T \le 50 $ , the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers on their own line: $ N \le 100000 $ , the number of graduate students (who are indexed by the integers $ 1 $ through $ N $ ), and $ M $ , the number of friendships among the students. Following this are $ M $ lines, each containing two integers $ i $ and $ j $ separated by a single space. Two integers $ i $ and $ j $ represent a mutual friendship between students $ i $ and $ j $ .
The total size of the input file does not exceed 2 MB.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a single number: the minimum number of desks Dr. Baws requires to seat the students.</div>
