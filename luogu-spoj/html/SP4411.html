<h1>EXPR3 - Counting Expressions</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Count the number of distinct expressions involving _n_ different operands **a**, **b**, **c**, etc. Only operators +, -, \*, / and parentheses are permitted. Single minus operator (for ex. -a\*b) is not allowed.
Two expression are distinct if for some valid input values (i.e. You won't divide some number by zero) **a**, **b**, **c**, ... , the two expressions leads to different results. For example, a/b/c and a/(b\*c) are the same expressions, but a/b+c and a/(b+c) are not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiply test cases. For each test case:
A single line - _n_.(1<= _n_ <=50).
Input terminates by a single zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case:
The number of different expressions, modulo 499999999999993.</div>
