<h1>HS08FOUR - Four colors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let there be given _n_ points: P $ _{1} $ ,P $ _{2} $ ...,P $ _{n} $ arranged in this order on a line. We would like to color them using four colors: white, black, red, and blue, in such a way that for every three consecutive points it is true that either
**1.** the colors of these three points are pairwise distinct, or
**2.** the color of some point is white.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>An integer _T_, denoting the number of testcases (_T_<100000). In each line you are given one positive integer ( n<1000000000 ). There are 5 input sets.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Find the number of possible colorings of the _n_ points. Since the answer can be very big, output only the answer modulo 1000000007.</div>
