<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>对于每个测试样例：
如果<string>是回文字符串，输出："<string>" is palindrome
否则，输出："<string>" is not palindrome
记得在每个测试用例后加上'\ n'</div>

<div>For each test case:
if <string> is palindrome, output: "<string>" is palindrome
else, output: "<string>" is not palindrome
remember to put '\\n' after each test case</div>
