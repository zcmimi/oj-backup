<h1>CODESPTG - Cliques</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A clique in a graph is set of nodes such that there is an edge between any two distinct nodes in the set. It is well known that finding the largest clique in a graph is a computationally tough problem and no polynomial time algorithm is known for it. However, you wonder what is is the mininum size of the largest clique in any graph with N nodes and M edges. Of course, the graph should have at most one edge between any two nodes and no edges connecting a node to itself.</div>
