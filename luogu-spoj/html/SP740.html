<h1>TRT - Treats for the Cows</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
FJ经常给产奶量高的奶牛发特殊津贴，于是很快奶牛们拥有了大笔不知该怎么花的钱．为此，约翰购置了N(1≤N≤2000)份美味的零食来卖给奶牛们．每天FJ售出一份零食．当然FJ希望这些零食全部售出后能得到最大的收益．这些零食有以下这些有趣的特性：
•零食按照1．．N编号，它们被排成一列放在一个很长的盒子里．盒子的两端都有开口，FJ每天可以从盒子的任一端取出最外面的一个．
•与美酒与好吃的奶酪相似，这些零食储存得越久就越好吃．当然，这样FJ就可以把它们卖出更高的价钱．
•每份零食的初始价值不一定相同．FJ进货时，第i份零食的初始价值为Vi(1≤Vi≤1000)(Vi指的是从盒子顶端往下的第i份零食的初始价值)．
•第i份零食如果在被买进后的第a天出售，则它的售价是vi×a．
FJ告诉了你所有零食的初始价值，并希望你能帮他计算一下，在这些零食全被卖出后，他最多能得到多少钱．
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式
第一行：一个整数n。
接下来的n行：每行一个整数Vi。
## 输出格式
FJ通过出售零食最多能得到的钱数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>FJ has purchased N (1 <= N <= 2000) yummy treats for the cows who get money for giving vast amounts of milk. FJ sells one treat per day and wants to maximize the money he receives over a given period time. The treats are interesting for many reasons:
- The treats are numbered 1..N and stored sequentially in single file in a long box that is open at both ends. On any day, FJ can retrieve one treat from either end of his stash of treats.
- Like fine wines and delicious cheeses, the treats improve with age and command greater prices.
- The treats are not uniform: some are better and have higher intrinsic value. Treat i has value v(i) (1 <= v(i) <= 1000).
- Cows pay more for treats that have aged longer: a cow will pay v(i)\*a for a treat of age a.
Given the values v(i) of each of the treats lined up in order of the index i in their box, what is the greatest value FJ can receive for them if he orders their sale optimally?
The first treat is sold on day 1 and has age a=1. Each subsequent day increases the age by 1.</div>
