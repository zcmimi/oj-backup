<h1>JASIEK - Jasiek</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Jasiek只有6岁，但他已经会很多东西了。他非常喜欢画画和谜语。今天早上，他从母亲那里得到一张网格纸和一支铅笔，然后开始画画。他的所有图纸都有一些共同的特点：
Jasiek彩色全网格正方形；
如果一些彩色网格方块相互接触，这意味着它们有一个共同的边或角；
所有网格方格都是连通的，这意味着每两个彩色网格方格之间都有一系列具有公共边的彩色网格方格；
没有白洞，也就是说，从每个白色网格框都可以画一条线到从未接触过任何彩色网格正方形的边界。
中午，妈妈打电话问Jasiek今天的照片是什么。Jasiek没有直接回答，而是用一系列的动作描述了这张照片，这些动作需要绕着边界上彩色方块的中心移动，即那些方块至少有一个共同的角和一个白色方块。Jasiek设置了起始正方形，然后给出了逆时针沿着边界正方形行走所需的移动顺序。妈妈对照片的复杂感到非常惊讶，特别是彩色方块的数量。根据Jasiek的描述，你能快速计算出图片中有多少彩色方块吗？
任务
编写一个程序
读取Jasiek对图片的描述，
计算彩色方块的数量，
写出结果。
输入输出格式
输入格式：
十个测试用例（一个接一个，你必须处理所有的！）.每个测试用例都是一系列行。每行只包含一个字符。字母P表示描述的开头。字母k表示描述的结束（和测试用例）。所有其他行（如有）都包含字母N、W、S或E（N表示北、W-西、S-南和E-东）。描述的每一行都对应于图片边界上某个正方形中心的相对位置。第一行和最后一行对应于同一个正方形。如果一个字母不是第一个或最后一个字母，它会告诉你逆时针旋转图片时，为了到达下一个边界正方形，你必须走哪条路。Jasiek的描述在浏览了一次图片后结束。描述的长度不超过20000个字母。
输出格式：
对于每个测试用例，您的程序应该只写（到标准输出）一行一个整数，等于Jasiek图片中彩色方块的数目。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Jasiek is only 6 years old, but he already has many skills. He likes drawing and asking riddles very much. This morning he got a sheet of grid paper and a pencil from his mother and he started drawing. All his drawings have some common properties:
- Jasiek colors full grid squares;
- if some coloured grid squares touch each other, it means they have a common edge or a corner;
- all grid squares are connected, which means between every two coloured grid squares there is a sequence of coloured grid squares, which have a common edge;
- there are no white holes, that is from every white grid box it is possible to draw a line to the boundary of the sheet which never touches any coloured grid square.
At noon mom phoned and asked what Jasiek's today's picture was. The boy didn't answer directly, but described the picture by a sequence of moves needed to walk around the centres of the coloured squares on its boundary, ie. those squares which have at least one common corner with a white square. Jasiek set the starting square and then gave the sequence of moves necessary to walk along the boundary squares anti-clockwise. Mom was very surprised by the complexity of the picture and especcialy by the number of coloured squares. Given Jasiek's description, can you quickly count how many coloured squares there are in the picture?
Task
----
Write a program which
- reads (from standard input) Jasiek's description of the picture,
- counts the number of coloured squares,
- writes out the outcome (to standard output).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each of the test cases is a series of lines. Each line consists of only one character. The letter _P_ means the beginning of the description. The letter _K_ means the end of the desription (and the test case). All other lines (if any) contain one of the letters N, W, S or E (N meaning North, W - West, S - South and E - East). Every line of the description corresponds to the relative position of the centre of some square on the boundary of the picture. The first and the last line correspond to the same square. A letter in a line other than the first or the last tells you which way you have to go in order to get to the next boundary square when going around the picture anti-clockwise. Jasiek's description finishes after going around the picture once. The length of the description doesn't exceed 20000 letters.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every testcase your program should write (to the standard output) only one line with one integer, equal to the number of coloured squares in Jasiek's picture.</div>
