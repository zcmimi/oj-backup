<h1>PLOT1 - Plotting functions (variation)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a function y=f(x) in RPN-notation plot it with stars (\*) and then (!) its derivation with crosses (+) for 0<=x<=20 with Δx=1 in a diagram with 21\*21 points (0<=x,y<=20). Empty fields are marked with dots (.). For plotting the real number y should be rounded to integer (-0.5 -> -1, -0.4 -> 0, 0.4 -> 0, 0.5 -> 1). The function and its derivation are continuous between 0 and 20.
The function definition uses only the following characters: 0123456789x.+-\*/^
'^' means 'power of'. Items are separated by space.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line the number N of functions, then N lines with one function.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The plot of each function and its derivation in 21 lines.</div>
