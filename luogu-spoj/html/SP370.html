<h1>ONEZERO - Ones and zeros</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Certain positive integers have their decimal representation consisting only of ones and zeros, and having at least one digit one, e.g. 101. If a positive integer does not have such a property, one can try to multiply it by some positive integer to find out whether the product has this property.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Number _K_ of test cases (_K_ is approximately 1000);
in each of the next _K_ lines there is one integer _n_ (_1 <= n <= 20000)_</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, your program should compute the smallest multiple of the number _n_ consisting only of digits 1 and 0 (beginning with 1).</div>
