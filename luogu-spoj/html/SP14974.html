<h1>UOFTAE - Foxling Feeding Frenzy</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You've come across $ N $ ( $ 1 \leq N \leq 200 $ ) adorable little Foxlings, and they're hungry! Luckily, you happen to have $ M $ ( $ 1 \leq M \leq 200 $ ) crackers on hand, and everyone knows that Foxen love crackers! You'd like to distribute all of your crackers, without splitting any of them, among the Foxlings - but you have to be careful. Foxling $ i $ must be fed at least $ A_i $ crackers, or it will remain hungry, but no more than $ B_i $ of them, or it will become hyper ( $ 1 \leq A_i \leq B_i \leq 200 $ ). You certainly don't want any hungry or hyper Foxlings on your hands, and you're curious as to how many ways this can be accomplished.
There are $ T $ ( $ 1 \leq T \leq 100 $ ) scenarios as described above. For each one, you'd like to determine the number of different distributions of your crackers that would satisfy all of the Foxlings, modulo $ 10^9+7 $ (as this value can be quite large).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line: 1 integer, $ T $
For each scenario:
First line: 2 integers, $ N $ and $ M $
Next $ N $ lines: 2 integers, $ A_i $ and $ B_i $ , for $ i = 1..N $</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each scenario:
Line 1: 1 integer, the number of valid cracker distributions modulo $ 10^9+7 $</div>
