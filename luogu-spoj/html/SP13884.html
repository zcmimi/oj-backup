<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
一扔！是由CandyCane LLC的知名开发者创建的流行益智游戏。开始游戏时场地上有一定数量的球。你的目标是把一个球扔向另一个球来把它撞出场地。当场地上只剩下一个球时游戏成功。
**当满足以下条件时球A可以撞击球B**
- 1.两球在同一行或同一列
- 2.两球不相邻
- 3.两球直接不存在其他球
如果撞击过程中球B的运行轨迹上存在球C，球B将会停在球C前一格，球C将会被撞出(球C轨迹中存在其他球时同理。注意球B和球C不能相邻，即每次撞击均满足条件2).
给出一个场景，如果它是有解的，输出"Yes",否则输出"No"
(原题可观看404视频[这是404视频](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfteaRTGyVw))
# 输入输出格式
## 输入格式
第一行，包括一个整数t，表示场景的数目。(1<=t<=100)
对于接下来的t个场景，有两个整数m,n,即拼图的行数和列数。(1<=m,n<=10)
每个场景有m行，每行有n个字符"."或"B"，"."代表该格子为空，"B"代表这个格子中有球。
你可以假设球的数目约等于 ( m x n ) /10。-
## 输出格式
t行，每行输出"Yes"或"No"，代表对应场景是否有解。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fling! is a popular puzzle game created by the well-known developers at CandyCane LLC.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP13884/72fe6c9a9752a2fb34f985edebfc16babc43e532.png)
The premise of the game is simple. You are given a certain number of balls on the screen to start. The goal is to fling one into another in order to knock the other off the screen. The puzzle is considered solved if you can do so while leaving only one ball remaining on the screen. Some might read this and think that it might not be too difficult, but the game gets challenging quickly. The problem is that you cannot fling two balls that are adjacent (i.e. next to) each other.
The first ball you choose can fling the 2nd ball if and only if..
1) The two balls exist in same row or same column
2) The two balls are not adjacent
3) There is no other ball in between the two balls
If there exist a 3rd ball after the 2nd ball in the same line of action, the 2nd ball takes the position just before the third ball, pushes the 3rd ball and the 3rd ball gets flinged. (This continues till a ball gets knocked off the screen. Note that 2nd ball and 3rd ball can be adjacent).
Given a Fling! puzzle, just print "Yes" if it is a valid puzzle(solvable) or "No" otherwise.
For better understanding of gameplay you may have a look at this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfteaRTGyVw). (optional)
**Input:**
The first line of the input consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line consists of two integers m and n, the number of rows and columns of the puzzle. Then follows the description of the board. A\[i\]\[j\] is '.' if the cell is empty or 'B' if the cell has a ball.
**Output:**
For each test case print "Yes" if the puzzle is valid or "No" otherwise. (case-sensitive).
**Input Constraints:**
1<=t<=100
1<=m,n<=10
You can assume that the number of balls in the board is approximately equal to ( m x n ) /10
