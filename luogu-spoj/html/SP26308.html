<h1>MAXI - Get higher and higher</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are travelling to Kullu Manili, a hill station in India. You saw some huge mountains and very curious to climb the highest ones. Assume that there are **n** mountains of height **hi** given.
But you were wondering about what could be the total height i need to climb if I climb only the mountain of maximum height only in a segment of k continuous mountains, considering all k segements possible. You want to calculate this for all k, such that 1<=k<=n.
Mathematically, we need to find the sum of maximum element in each possible continuous segment of size k.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an input **n**.
