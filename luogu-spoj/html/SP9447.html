<h1>GENETICS - Genetics</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Genetic engineering is fun. The scientists have gathered several DNAs and want to create something new out of those. Each DNAs can be represented as a sequence of bases A, G, T, C. Let DNA\[a..b\] be the subsequence of DNA starting from index a finishing in b inclusive, and DNA\[a..\] be the subsequence of DNA starting from index a to the end. Scientist can perform the following operations on the DNAs:
- cross operation – they take DNA1 and DNA2 and numbers k1 and k2. Then two new DNAs are created: DNA3 = DNA1\[1..k1\]+DNA2\[k2+1..\] and DNA4 = DNA2\[1..k2\]+DNA1\[k1+1..\].
- mutate operation – they take a DNA, number k and one of the bases. Then they replace the base in position k in DNA with that base.
- also they need to know certain characteristics of those DNAs. So they can perform count operation – they take DNA and numbers k1 and k2 (k1 <= k2). This operation should return the number of A, G, T, C bases in DNA\[k1..k2\].
The initial DNAs are numbered from 1 to n, where n is the amount of those DNAs. The new DNAs created in the cross operations are numbered with consecutive integers. You are to write a program to help scientists perform those operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input file contains number n – the amount of initial DNAs. Each of the following n lines contains the description of each DNA. The next line contains number q – the amount of operations to perform. The next q lines contain the description of each operation in the following form:
- CROSS id1 id2 k1 k2
- MUTATE id k m
- COUNT id k1 k2</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each count operation print four integers: the number of each of the bases in the given subsequence of the given DNA.</div>
