<h1>LARSUBP - Large subsequence Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a string **S** which contains only digit-characters. How many subsequences can be obtained from S such that every digit is strictly greater than all previous digits in that subsequence.
As for example if S=7598 then there are 8 subsequences which follow the above constraint. These are 7,5,9,8,79,78,59,58. Notice that 7598 is not a required subsequence because 7>5 and 9>8.
Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input starts with an integer **T (, denoting the number of test cases. Each case contains a string **S**. The length of S does not exceed **10000**. S does not contain any leading zeros.**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case, print the a string(without quotes) **"Case i: "** follwed by number of subsequences where "i" is test case number. Answer may be very large, so output it **modulo 10^9+7**.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2\n4\n7598</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Case 1: 1\nCase 2: 8For small constraints: www.spoj.com/problems/SUBP/</code></pre>
