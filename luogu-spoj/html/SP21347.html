<h1>TULIPNUM - Tulip And Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Little Tulip recently learnt about how to write numbers. So she wrote some numbers in a paper in a line. But she never wrote a number which is less than the prevous one.
Now she want to know how many different numbers are in a given range.
In short, you are given an array of N integers indexed from 1 to N, and q queries, each in the form i j, you have to find the number of distinct integers from index i to j (inclusive).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input starts with an integer T (
The first line of a case is a blank line. The next line contains two integers N (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print the case number in a single line. Then for each query you have to print a line containing number of distinct integers from index i to j.</div>
