<h1>MUSIC - Musical Optimization</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Bessie the cow used to write musical melody. A musical melody is represented as a sequence of N (1 <= N <= 100,000) notes numbered 1..N. Note i is represented by the integer A $ _{i} $ (-10,000 <= A $ _{i} $ <= 10,000).
To Bessie's cow-like mind, a musical melody is called 'perfect' if and only if the sum of all the notes in any of its consecutive subsequences is strictly positive.
For a given musical melody, Bessie wants to make it perfect, but she wants to change the melody as little as possible.
Thus, to perfect the melody, she repeatedly chooses a consecutive subsequence of the melody, \[x, y\] (1 < x <= y < N), whose sum S is negative. Then she adds S to both A $ _{x-1} $ and A $ _{y+1} $ , while subtracting S from both A $ _{x} $ and A $ _{y} $ . (It is possible to subtract from the same note twice if x = y.)
Given a musical melody, compute the minimum number of steps to make the melody perfect.</div>
