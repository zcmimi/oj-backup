<h1>MAZE - The Long and Narrow Maze</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Consider a maze consisting of 3 rows of n square blocks each. The passageways in every block match one of three possible patterns, numbered 0 (empty), 1 (straight) and 2 (bent), as depicted below.
![Illustration of possible patterns](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP139/a4d1f6738565cd7ab80930a025fafbf84614ba48.png) Your task is to determine whether it is possible to create a passage in a given maze, with an entrance at the left end and an outlet at the right end of the maze, only by rotating some of the squares of the maze by a multiple of 90 degrees.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n - the number of squares in one row of the maze (1<= n <= 200000). The next n lines contain three integers each, denoting the types of blocks in consecutive columns of the maze. A column description is of the form _a b c_ (0<=_a,b,c_<=2), where _a_ represents the type of the block in the first row, _b_ - in the second row and _c_ - in the third row.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case output the word yes if it is possible to rotate the squares so as to form a connection between the left and right edge, and the word no in the opposite case.</div>
