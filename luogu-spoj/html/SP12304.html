<h1>INVDIV - Smallest Inverse Sum of Divisors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>First, we define σ(**i**) = Sum of all positive divisors of **i**.
example: all positive divisors of 60 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60}
so σ(60)=1+2+3+4+5+6+10+12+15+20+30+60=168
Now for the task: given an integer **n** find smallest integer **i** such that σ(**i**)=**n****.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is an integer **T**(1 T
For each test case, there is an integer **n**(1 n</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output Smallest Inverse Sum of Divisors of **n**. if **n** doesn't have inverse, output -1.</div>
