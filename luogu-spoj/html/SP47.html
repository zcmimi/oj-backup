<h1>SCRAPER - Skyscraper Floors</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>现在，我们越来越需要摩天大楼了。很多城市的地皮都很贵，而摩天大楼占不了多少地方却能容纳很多人，建造它们是一个很好的选择。现在，摩天大楼在办公、居住方面都有很大的作用。不过，这种建筑唯一的缺点就是：到达比较高的楼层需要很长时间。当然，这些摩天大楼已经配备了楼梯和几部电梯，但一般的电梯远远达不到速度要求，到达高层的时间仍然很长。想象一下你要从顶楼下到一楼，而且还有好多其他楼层的人也要往下走，于是电梯几乎在每一层都要停一下，而且它在比较高的几层就已经满载了，下面楼层的人几乎没办法坐电梯，而且这严重地影响了他们的工作和生活。如果摩天大楼配备更多的电梯，这个问题当然会被缓解，但仍然不能被彻底解决。很多人会按每一个电梯的按钮并且搭乘最先到达的电梯，所以大多数电梯仍然会在每一层都停一下。
但是，问题总会有解决的办法。ACM团队的总部坐落在一栋带有特殊的电梯控制及运行系统的摩天大楼里。这些电梯并不会在每一层都停一下，而只会在某些特定的楼层停下。而且，所有的电梯只能下到第Y层（我们称为起始楼层）而且不能再往下走。同时，还有一部非常大的电梯可以在所有电梯的起始楼层停靠。
ACM团队现在面临着一个非常严重的问题：ACM总部在这周要移动办公地点（可能在别的楼层）。不幸的是，那部非常大的可以在每一部电梯的起始层停靠的电梯坏了，所以并不是每一层的人都可以乘坐电梯到达一层。有一件非常大的家具没法从楼梯搬运——它大到无法进入楼梯间的门！你的任务就是编写一个程序，告诉ACM团队这件家具可不可以只通过电梯被搬运到新的办公地点。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>What a great idea it is to build skyscrapers! Using not too large area of land, which is very expensive in many cities today, the skyscrapers offer an extremely large utility area for flats or offices. The only disadvantage is that it takes too long to get to the upper floors. Of course these skyscrapers have to be equiped not only with a stairway but also with several elevators. But even using ordinary elevators is very slow. Just imagine you want to get from the very top floor to the base floor and many other people on other floors want the same. As a result the elevator stops on almost every floor and since its capacity is limited and the elevator is already full from the upper floors, most stops are useless and just cause a delay. If there are more elevators in the skyscrapers, this problem is a little bit eliminated but still not completely. Most people just press all the buttons of all the elevators and then take the first one so that all elevators will stop on the floor anyway.
However, the solution exists as we shall see. The Antique Comedians of Midilesia headquarters reside in a skyscraper with a very special elevator system. The elevators do not stop on every floor but only on every X-th floor. Moreover each elevator can go just to a certain floor Y (called starting floor) and cannot go any lower. There is one high-capacity elevator which can stop on every elevator's starting floor.
The ACM has a big problem. The headquarters should be moved to another office this week, possibly on a different floor. Unfortunately, the high-capacity elevator is out of order right now so it is not always possible to go to the base floor. One piece of furniture cannot be moved using the stairway because it is too large to pass through the stairway door. You are to write a program that decides whether it is possible to move a piece of furniture from the original office to the other.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of N cases (equal to about 2000). The first line contains only one positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case starts with a line containing four integers F, E, A, B, where F, 1 <= F < 50000000 determines the number of floors in the skyscraper (this means that there are floors 0 to F-1), E, 0 < E < 100 is the number of elevators and A, B, 0 <= A,B < F are numbers of the two floors between which the piece of furniture should be moved. Then follow E lines. Each of them contains description of one elevator. There are exactly two integers X and Y, X > 0, Y >= 0 at each line. Y determines, that the elevator starts on the Y-th floor and X determines, that it stops on every X-th floor, eg. for X = 3, Y = 7 the elevator stops on floors 7, 10, 13, 16, etc.).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case, print exactly one line. If floor B is reachable from floor A not using the stairway, print the sentence 'It is possible to move the furniture.', otherwise print 'The furniture cannot be moved.'.</div>
