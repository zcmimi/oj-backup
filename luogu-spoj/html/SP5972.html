<h1>MAXSUMSQ - Maximum Sum Sequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Given an array A having n elements, let X be the maximum sum of any contiguous sequence in the array. How many contiguous sequences in A sum up to X ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains T the number of test cases. There follow 2T lines, 2 for each test case. The first line contains the n, the number of elements in the array. The second line contains n space seperated integers Ai.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Output T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output two space seperated integers; the maximum sequence sum, and the number of sequences which obtain this maximum sum.</div>
