<h1>CATM - The Cats and the Mouse</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
在大小为n×m的矩形区域中，有一只老鼠和两只猫。老鼠是第一个移动的，然后每只猫移动，然后再移动老鼠，依此类推。在每次移动中，老鼠和猫都可以垂直或水平移动一个方格。如果老鼠站在场的边缘，那么在下一步移动时，它可以从场上跳下并逃脱。如果在下一次移动中，其中一只猫用老鼠移动到老鼠所在的地方，则老鼠被抓获。
你要编写一个程序，知道老鼠和两只猫的初始位置，寻找老鼠是否有任何方法可以逃离，假设每只猫都会尽力捕捉老鼠。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
在输入的第一行中给出了两个整数n和m，不超过100，其中n是行数，m是列数。第二行包含数字k (k<=10)，它定义的是给定字段的测试样例数。在接下来的k行中，给出了小鼠和猫的初始位置。字段中的位置由两个数字给出：第一个是行的编号，第二个是列的编号。前两个整数是老鼠的坐标，接下来的四个整数是猫的坐标。
### 输出格式：
您必须为每个测试样例输出带有答案的k行。如果老鼠可以逃脱，则答案为是，否则为否。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> In a rectangular field of size n by m squares there is a mouse and two cats. The mouse is the first to make a move, then each of the cats makes a move, then again its the mouse's turn, and so on. In each move both the mouse and the cats can move exactly one square vertically or horizontally. If the mouse is standing at the edge of the field then in its next move it can jump off the field and is saved from the cats. If in the next move one of the cats moves to the field with the mouse then there is no escape for the mouse ... =(
You are to write a program which, knowing the initial positions of mouse and the two cats, will find out if there is any way for the mouse to escape from the cats, assuming of course that each cat will do its best to catch the mouse.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line of input two integers n and m are given, not exceeding 100, where n is the number of rows, and m - the number of columns. The second line contains a number k \[k <= 10\], which defines the number of test cases for the given field. In the next k lines the initial positions of the mouse and the cats are given. The position in the field is given by two numbers: the first is the number of the row, the second is the number of the column. The first two integers are the coordinates of the mouse, the next four integers are the coordinates of the cats.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> You must output k lines with answers for each test case. The answer is YES, if the mouse can escape or NO otherwise.</div>
