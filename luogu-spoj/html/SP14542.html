<h1>PYTRIP2 - Pythagorean triples (medium)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Pythagoras is credited, by tradition, for the first proof of the relation **_a_ $ ^{2} $ + _b_ $ ^{2} $ = _c_ $ ^{2} $** in any right angled triangle where **_c_** is hypotenuse and **_a_** and **_b_** are the [catheti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathetus).
We define a Pythagorean triple as a set of three positive integers **_a_**, **_b_**, and **_c_** which satisfy the above equation , ie , **_a_ $ ^{2} $ + _b_ $ ^{2} $ = _c_ $ ^{2} $** .
{3,4,5} is the most common example of such triples.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains an integer **_T_**, the number of test cases.
Each of the next **_T_** lines contains two integers **_N_**, **_M_**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print on a single line the number of Pythagorean triplet **_{a,b,c}_** such that **_N_** .</div>
