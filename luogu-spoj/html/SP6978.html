<h1>PERMPATT - Check 1324</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>T次询问，每次询问给出一个长度为n的排列P，问是否存在1<=i1<i2<i3<i4<=n，使得P[i1]<P[i3]<P[i2]<P[i4]。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a permutation P\[1...n\] of {1,2,...n}, you should output if the permutation contains a pattern of the form 1324. That is, do there exist indices 1 <= i1 < i2 < i3 < i4 <= n such that P\[i1\] < P\[i3\] < P\[i2\] < P\[i4\]. For example, P = 6 8 5 4 9 3 7 2 1 10 contains one: the indices 1, 2, 7, 10 correspond to the sequence 6 8 7 10 which is a 1324 pattern.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T, the number of test cases
Each of the next T lines contains **n** (1 <= n <= 100000), followed by **n** integers, representing a permutation of \[1,2,..,n\].
SUM( n \* log $ _{2} $ (n)) over all test cases <= 10 $ ^{8} $ . Do not assume anything else about the number of test cases or their distribution.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output T lines, one per test case: "yes"(without quotes) if the permutation contains a 1324 pattern or "no" (without quotes) otherwise.
**Warning:** Huge I/O</div>
