<h1>GCJ101AB - Make it Smooth</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You have a one-dimensional array of **N** pixels. Each pixel has a value, represented by a number between 0 and 255, inclusive. The distance between two pixels is the absolute difference of their numbers.
You can perform each of the following operations zero or more times:
1. With cost **D**, delete any pixel, so its original neighbors become neighboring pixels.
2. With cost **I**, insert one pixel of any value into any position - either between two existing pixels, or before the first pixel, or after the last pixel.
3. You can change the value of any pixel. The cost is the absolute difference of the old value of the pixel and the new value of the pixel.
The array is smooth if any neighboring pixels have distance at most **M**. Find the minimum possible cost of a sequence of operations that makes the array smooth.
Note: The empty array - the array containing no pixels - is considered to be smooth.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow, each with two lines. The first line is in the form "**D I M N**", the next line contains **N** numbers **a $ _{i} $** : the values of the pixels from left to the right.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the minimum cost to make the input array smooth.</div>
