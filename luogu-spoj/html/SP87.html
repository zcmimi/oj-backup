<h1>FOOTBALL - Football</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题面描述：一个足球有12个黑色五边形块和20个白色六边形块，每个黑色五边形周围有六个白色六边形块，每个白色六边形块周围有三个黑色五边形块和三个白色六边形块。现在在这个足球上划定一个有n个顶点的多边形，并把该多边形的范围内的块变成绿色，问进行该项操作后，足球上有多少个黑色块，白色块，绿色块。
输入：第一行为t，表示有t组数据 接下来的t * 2行，第一行为该多边形的顶点数n，第二行有n个数，代表顶点1~n所相邻的绿色块的数量。
数据保证顶点1与顶点n相连所得到的边是一白色六边形块与另一绿色六边形块的共边。
输出：三个数，分别为黑色块的数量，白色块的数量，绿色块的数量</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Eric has a classic football that is made of 32 pieces of leather: 12 black pentagons and 20 white hexagons. Each pentagon adjoins 5 hexagons and each hexagon adjoins 3 pentagons and 3 hexagons. Eric drew a polygon (i.e. a closed line without intersections) along the edges of the pieces. The polygon divided the ball into two parts and Eric painted one of them green.
![Eric's football](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP87/f097a1f6b3c98f1918ba99d5652f33ff474e0699.png) He is curious if given a description of the polygon you are able to compute the number of black, white and green pieces?
### Task
Write a program that:
- reads the description of a polygon,
- computes the number of black, white and green pieces,
- writes the result.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line of the input contains one integer n being the number of vertices of the polygon. The second line of the input contains n integers a $ _{1} $ , a $ _{2} $ ,..., a $ _{n} $ separated by single spaces. Integer a $ _{i} $ (equal 1 or 2) is the number of green pieces adjoining the i-th vertex of the polygon. The side of the polygon connecting the n-th and the first vertex always lies between two hexagons.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case the first and only line of the output contains three integers b, w and g - the numbers of black, white and green pieces respectively.</div>
