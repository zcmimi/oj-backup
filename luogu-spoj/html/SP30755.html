<h1>ADAGCD - Ada and GCD</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug got interesting homework. She had to count gcd of a few numbers. As she is a great mathematician, she done it in meanwhile (in fact, she submited it during the class it was assigned in). The teacher was impressed so he gave Ada a bonus homework (for bonus points). It is same as previous one with a little difference - there are bigger numbers.
Since the number are too large to be written as numbers, they are written as product of lesser numbers. Find their gcd.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input consists of **2 , the number of numbers for which Ada wants to find their gcd.**
Each of the next **N** lines contains an integer **1 followed by **M $ _{i} $** integers, **1 , the numbers whose product is the **i $ ^{th} $** number.****
The sum of all **M $ _{i} $** won't exceed **10 $ ^{6} $**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the **gcd** on a single line. Since this number might be pretty big, output it modulo **10 $ ^{9} $ +7** (**1000000007**)</div>
