<h1>FN16OIL - Oil</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一家石油公司最近在一片区域开采石油,这片区域可以看作一个二维平面，
其中 x 轴平行于地面，x 坐标表示地表的水平位置，而 y 轴垂直于地面，y 坐标
表示深度。这片区域内还有 n 个石油矿，每个石油矿都可以看作一条平行于 x
轴的线段，其中石油的储量即为该线段的长度，如下图就对应着样例一的输入：

现在这家石油公司想要挖一个石油井，石油井可以看作一条与 x 轴相交的直
线（如上图中蓝色虚线所示），通过挖石油井，这家石油公司能获取到所有与石
油井有公共点的石油矿内的石油（端点处或者在线段内均算）。
你的任务就是替这家公司找到一个挖石油井的方案，使得其能获得最大储量
的石油，为了方便，你只需要输出最大储量即可。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A large part of the world economy depends on oil, which is why research into new methods for finding and extracting oil is still active. Profits of oil companies depend in part on how efficiently they can drill for oil. The International Crude Petroleum Consortium (ICPC) hopes that extensive computer simulations will make it easier to determine how to drill oil wells in the best possible way.
Drilling oil wells optimally is getting harder each day – the newly discovered oil deposits often do not form a single body, but are split into many parts. The ICPC is currently concerned with stratified deposits, as illustrated below.
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP27098/e8086d4505b064a8f44fcd544fc27347d66033d4.png)
To simplify its analysis, the ICPC considers only the 2-dimensional case, where oil deposits are modeled as horizontal line segments parallel to the earth’s surface. The ICPC wants to know how to place a single oil well to extract the maximum amount of oil. The oil well is drilled from the surface along a straight line and can extract oil from all deposits that it intersects on its way down, even if the intersection is at an endpoint of a deposit. One such well is shown as a dashed line in Figure, hitting three deposits. In this simple model the amount of oil contained in a deposit is equal to the width of the deposit. Can you help the ICPC determine the maximum amount of oil that can be extracted by a single well?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases. Please process until EOF is reached. For each test case:
The first line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 2\, 000 $ ), which is the number of oil deposits. This is followed by $ n $ lines, each describing a single deposit. These lines contain three integers $ x_0 $ , $ x_1 $ , and $ y $ giving the deposit’s position as the line segment with endpoints $ (x_0,y) $ and $ (x_1,y) $ . These numbers satisfy $ |x_0|, |x_1| \leq 10^6 $ and $ 1 \le y \le 10^6 $ . No two deposits will intersect, not even at a point.</div>
