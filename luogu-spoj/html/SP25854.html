<h1>PLNDROME - Palindrome Or Not</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>```
It's English class now. So John is bored as usual. To get over his boredom he is doing a very strange thing. He writes an arbitrary string on his notebook and then keeps changing a single character of the string every time and tries to find out  if the string has become a palindrome.
As John is very smart this task is very simple for him.
But how simple is it for you ? Can you be as smart as the great John?
You'll have to write a code that solves the similar problem and hopefully as fast as John.
 
INPUT:
First line of the input will be an integer T (T<=15) denoting number of test cases.
Each test case starts with an integer N (1<=N<=100000) denoting the length of the string.
Next line will contain the string consisting of only small letters of English alphabet (a,b,c,...,x,y,z).
Then there will be another integer M (1<=M<=10000) denoting number of queries.
Each query will be in the form:  i x
where i will be an integer (1<=i<=N) and x will be a character. (a<= x<=z)
and it will mean that the i-th character of the string has been changed to x.
 
OUTPUT:
First you will have to print the test case number.
Then for each query in  the test case you will have to print "YES" if the given string has become a plaindrome. Otherwise print  "NO". (without the quotes )
See sample input/output and expalination for details.
 
Sample Input
Sample output
1
11
madamimadam
6
6 z
1 a
11 b
5 z
1 b
7 z
 
Case 1:
YES
NO
NO
NO
NO
YES
Explaination:
After the 1st query the string is: madamzmadam
which is a palindrome
 
After the 2nd query the string is: aadamzmadam
which is  NOT a palindrome
 
After the 3rd query the string is: aadamzmadab
which is  NOT a palindrome
 
After the 4th query the string is: aadazzmadab
which is  NOT a palindrome
 
After the 5th query the string is: badazzmadab
which is  NOT a palindrome
 
After the 6th query the string is: badazzzadab
which is a palindrome
