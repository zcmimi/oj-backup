<h1>PCLNMBR - Peculiar Number</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ajoy has got some spare time today. He is using this spare time to think of a particular kind of number.
He calls it ‘Peculiar Number’.
A peculiar number is define by three integers A, B and C and has the following characteristics.
1) If a number is a multiple of A but not a multiple of B then it is a peculiar number.
2) If a number is a multiple of both A and B then it will be a peculiar number only if it is also a multiple of number C. Otherwise it is not a peculiar number.
Now, Ajoy is trying to find the Nth peculiar number for a fixed A, B and C.
But Ajoy does not have all day. So he needs your help to solve the problem.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the input contains four integers A, B, C and M where (1 <= A, B, C <= 10 $ ^{3} $ ) and (1 <= M <= 10 $ ^{5} $ ) contraints hold.
M denotes the number of queries.
Each of the next M line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 10 $ ^{9} $ ).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each query, print the Nth peculiar number.</div>
