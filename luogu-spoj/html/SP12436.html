<h1>THEPOOL - The One-Dimensional Pool Table</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A set of N billiard balls are set on a one-dimensional table. The table is 10 $ ^{5} $ meters long, with two pockets at either side. Each ball has zero width and there is no friction so it is moving with a fixed velocity of either left or right and bounces back in a [perfect elastic collision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision) from other balls it encounter on its way (or drop into one of the pockets). Your job is to keep track of the balls' movements.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first number, N, is the number of balls (<= 10 $ ^{5} $ ).
This is followed by N pairs of numbers: the distance in meters from the left end of the table and the velocity (positive speed meaning it moves towards right).
The next line tells you which ball you have to track ( 1 <= tracked ball <= N).
The last line tells you the time T at which you have to locate the tracked ball.
Note: Each number is on a separate line.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You have to output the position (from the left end) of the tracked ball after time T.</div>
