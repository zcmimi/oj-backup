<h1>IITKWPCL - Find Distances In A Plane</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Feluda loves reading city maps a lot. Now he has got a map of a city where each house is denoted with its x and y coordinate. As he is interested in estimating how good is arrangement of city, Should he would ask you these two questions.
1. What is minimum distance between any two houses ?
2. What is maximum distance between any two houses ?
Now given n points in a plane, You have to answer these two questions? As Feluda is scared by precision of decimal number representation in computers, you should tell Feluda the square of these distances.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line will contain n : no of houses. (n >= 2 && n <= 10^5)
Then next n lines where each line will contain x and y coordinate of house seperated by a single space. (-10^9 <= x , y <= 10^9).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one line containing squares of minimum and maximum distance respectively seperated by single space.</div>
