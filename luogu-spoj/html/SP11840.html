<h1>SEGSQRSS - Sum of Squares with Segment Tree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Segment trees are extremely useful. In particular "Lazy Propagation" (i.e. [see here, for example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10832954/data-mapping-and-lazy-propagation-in-segment-tree)) allows one to compute sums over a range in O(lg(n)), and update ranges in O(lg(n)) as well. In this problem you will compute something much harder:
**The sum of squares over a range with range updates of 2 types:**
**1) increment in a range**
**2) set all numbers the same in a range.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There will be **T** (**T** <= 25) test cases in the input file. First line of the input contains two positive integers, **N** (**N** <= 100,000) and **Q** (**Q** <= 100,000). The next line contains **N** integers, each at most 1000. Each of the next **Q** lines starts with a number, which indicates the type of operation:
2 **st nd** -- return the sum of the squares of the numbers with indices in \[**st**, **nd**\] {i.e., from **st** to **nd** inclusive} (1 <= **st** <= **nd** <= **N**).
1 **st nd x** -- add "x" to all numbers with indices in \[**st**, **nd**\] (1 <= **st** <= **nd** <= **N**, and -1,000 <= **x** <= 1,000).
0 **st nd x** -- set all numbers with indices in \[**st**, **nd**\] to "**x**" (1 <= **st** <= **nd** <= **N**, and -1,000 <= **x** <= 1,000).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case output the “Case <caseno>:” in the first line and from the second line output the sum of squares for each operation of type 2. Intermediate overflow will not occur with proper use of 64-bit signed integer.</div>
