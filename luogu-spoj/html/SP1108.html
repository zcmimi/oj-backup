<h1>CTRICK - Card Trick</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>【问题描述】
有一位超级幻术师，他拿了一包总数为N张的卡片，他把这些卡片倒扣，进行一下操作步骤：
1.把顶部的卡片移到最底部。拿走并翻开此时最上层的卡片，它是1号卡片。
2.把顶部的卡片移到最底部，执行两遍。拿走并翻开此时最上层的卡片，它是2号卡片。
3.把顶部的卡片移到最底部，执行三遍······
······
4.这样下去直到最后一张卡片被翻开，它是N号卡片。
超级幻术师想知道如何安排这些卡片才能展示给观众这令人印象深刻的魔法。
【输入】
第一行，一个正整数K，表示有K组测试方案；
接下来的K行，每行一个正整数N，表示该测试方案的卡片总数。
【输出】
K行，每行输出卡片从1到N的恰当排列，以空格隔开。第一个数字表示顶部的卡片。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The magician shuffles a small pack of cards, holds it face down and performs the following procedure:
1. The top card is moved to the bottom of the pack. The new top card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Ace of Spades.
2. Two cards are moved one at a time from the top to the bottom. The next card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Two of Spades.
3. Three cards are moved one at a time…
4. This goes on until the nth and last card turns out to be the n of Spades.
This impressive trick works if the magician knows how to arrange the cards beforehand (and knows how to give a false shuffle). Your program has to determine the initial order of the cards for a given number of cards, 1</div>
