<h1>TOE1 - Tic-Tac-Toe ( I )</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
给出一个9*9的棋盘，判断这个棋盘能否成为井字棋游戏的一部分，其中X先下，O后下。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
第一行输入一个数n,表示输入的棋盘总数。
接下来多行表示棋盘，每两个棋盘之间有一个换行。
### 输出格式：
对于每个输入样例，输出'yes'或'no',表示这能否成为井字棋游戏的一部分。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tic Tac Toe is a child's game played on a 3 by 3 grid. One player, X, starts by placing an X at an unoccupied grid position. Then the other player, O, places an O at an unoccupied grid position. Play alternates between X and O until the grid is filled or one player's symbols occupy an entire line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) in the grid.
We will denote the initial empty Tic Tac Toe grid with nine dots. Whenever X or O plays we fill in an X or an O in the appropriate position. The example below illustrates each grid configuration from the beginning to the end of a game in which X wins.
