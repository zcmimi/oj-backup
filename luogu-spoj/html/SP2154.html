<h1>KRUSKAL - Kruskal</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一只三头猴子在走它（它们？）从宿舍到大学宁静和平的路。它决定坐地铁。但它一进车站，就被一个拿着手电筒的怪人拦住了，他说了些奇怪的话……
“我是一个秘密团体的仆人，我掌握着质数圣火。你对偏导数的有限知识不会对你有用！黎曼之焰！你不能通过！你没发在他的比赛中赢过Kruskal！”
（在其他情况下，许多人会用分心和跑动的方法越过邪恶的Kruskal来进入地铁，然而在这种情况下，是不可能的：没人会在看见前面的猴子时听到“嘿！看你身后！一只三头猴子！”后转过身来的）
So，比些什么？
这是一个双人游戏，一开始有n对火柴（不一定相等）在每一回合中，一个玩家只能从一个堆中移除火柴，并且他必须移除1到k个火柴，包括1和k个火柴。（就是说如果k=4，你就可以在任意一堆中移掉1,2,3或4根火柴）如果一个玩家移动后某个堆中火柴数是一个素数，他就会获胜。三头猴子先动。
输入格式：一共m组数据，每组数据包含：两个整数n，k，以及每堆火柴数量a_1,a_2……a_n。
输出格式：m行，若三头猴子能赢，输出"YES"；要不然输出"NO"（不带引号）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A three-headed monkey was on his (theirs?) peaceful way from his dorm to the university. He decided to use the subway. But as soon as he descended into the station, he was stopped by a strange geek with a flashlight, saying strange words...
_"I am a servant of the Secret Group Order, wielder of the flame of Primes. Your limited knowledge of partial derivatives will not avail you, flame of Riemann! You shall not pass! You can't beat Kruskal in his game!"_
The three-headed monkey shook his head. The left one. But there was no way out. If he wanted to get to the university in time, he had to play.
(Many others in his situation would use the distract-and-run tactics to get past the evil Kruskal into the subway. However, this was not possible in this case : nobody will turn around upon hearing _"Hey! Look behind you! A three-headed monkey!"_ when he already sees the monkey in front of him...)
So, what was the game about? It is a two-player game. At the beginning there are **N** (not necessarily equal) heaps of matches. On each turn, a player may only remove matches from one heap only, and he has to remove between 1 and **K** matches, inclusive. A player wins if after his move the size of some heap is a prime number. The three-headed monkey moves first.</div>
