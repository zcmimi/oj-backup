<h1>AMR10C - Square Free Factorization</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You all know about factorization of an integer. Here we want you to factor a number into as few factors as possible. That is easy, you say, just have the number itself, and that will be the smallest number of factors i.e. 1.
But wait, I haven't finished -- each of the factors that you find must be square-free. A square-free number, however you factor it, won't have any factor that is a perfect square. Of course, you can never include 1 as a factor.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input is the number of test cases T.
The next T lines each have an integer N.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
