<h1>CLTZ - Collatz</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let N be a positive integer, Consider the following recurrence: f(1) = N and f(K) = (0.5 + 2.5 \* (f(K-1) mod 2)) \* f(K-1) + (f(K-1) mod 2) if K>1. For a given N you have to compute the smallest L for which f(L)=1 (such an L always exists for N's in the input).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each line contains a positive integer N in decimal notation. You can be sure that N and all intermediate results are not bigger than 10^1888. Input terminated by EOF.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each number N in the input print one line with the value of L in decimal notation.</div>
