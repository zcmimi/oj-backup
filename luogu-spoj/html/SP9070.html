<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Progressive climate change has forced the Byteburg authorities to build a huge lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings within the city. These buildings form a row along a single street, and are numbered from ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/17e23bd9f4448274b895d37e159cb09751fdf2de.png) to ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/169265ff2535c9e3f13c7674d3e988cc0267cb40.png).
The heights of the buildings and the lightning conductor are non-negative integers. Byteburg's limited funds allow construction of only a single lightning conductor. Moreover, as you would expect, the higher it will be, the more expensive.
The lightning conductor of height ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/67c86636710472fd55153ecc9149909d188e69bd.png) located on the roof of the building ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/af121dc60b0f474c5ebf06392d630180cf0b86f7.png) (of height ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/cb6e11da1ecb979beea9b15972a6727ba1d2adaf.png)) protects the building ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/9abe23f8a6558829180116605bad3d08b1aa9c43.png) (of height ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/f199ed28b22b7088d85b510ea9863ae25ee78c48.png)) if the following inequality holds:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/1a406958d9cd57e472067c35e20b59b7556db88b.png)
where ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/7cb601d9536bb3564d3928b6fc706600350d568f.png) denotes the absolute value of the difference between ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/af121dc60b0f474c5ebf06392d630180cf0b86f7.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/9abe23f8a6558829180116605bad3d08b1aa9c43.png).
Byteasar, the mayor of Byteburg, asks your help. Write a program that, for every building ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/af121dc60b0f474c5ebf06392d630180cf0b86f7.png), determines the minimum height of a lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings if it were put on top of the building ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/af121dc60b0f474c5ebf06392d630180cf0b86f7.png).
Input
-----
In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/169265ff2535c9e3f13c7674d3e988cc0267cb40.png) (![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9070/189daf92c94d3bb53ae2da1a16af4dcdf098edba.png)) that denotes the number of buildings in Byteburg.
