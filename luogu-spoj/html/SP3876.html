<h1>TABLIC - Tablica</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/TABLIC/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/TABLIC/vn/)Ivo has an N×N table. The table has the integers 1 through N $ ^{2} $ inscribed in row-major order. The following operations can be done on the table:
1\. Rotate a row – all cells in a single row are rotated right, so that the number in the last column moves to the first.
2\. Rotate a column – all cells in a single column are rotated down, so that the number in the last row moves to the first.
Ivo occasionally feels the urge to move a number X to cell (R, C) and proceeds as follows:
- While X is not in column C, rotate the row it is in.
- While X is not in row R, rotate the column it is in.
Ivo wants to move K numbers one after another. Write a program that calculates the number of rotations needed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers N (2 ≤ N ≤ 10 000) and K (1 ≤ K ≤ 1000), the table dimension and the number of moves.
Each of the following K lines contains three integers X (1 ≤ X ≤ N $ ^{2} $ ), R and C (1 ≤ R, C ≤ N), the description of one move Ivo wants to make. Ivo does the moves in the order in which they are given.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output K lines; for each move, output the number of rotations needed.</div>
