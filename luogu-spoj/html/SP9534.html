<h1>JZPLIT - Turn on the lights</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个$n*m$的$01$矩阵，现有一种操作。
点击$(i,j)$位置则使第$i$行和第$j$列$01$翻转。
现要求最后矩阵变成全$0$矩阵，输出点击方案。
输出格式，一个$n*m$的$01$矩阵，$(i,j)$为$1$表示点击了$(i,j)$。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Recently Zippy received a puzzle. It is an n\*m matrix. In each cell of the matrix, there is a switch and a light. Once he flips the switch in a cell, lights in the same column or the same row as the cell (including itself) change to its opposite state (which means: on->off off->on). Zippy wants to turn on all the lights. Please help him to solve the puzzle.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line, n, m.
The following n lines, each line is a m-length string, represting the original state. (0 means on and 1 means off)
1<=n,m<=1000
First line, n, m.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>n lines, each line is a m-length string. It's obvious that if a valid solution exists, there exists a solution that every switch is flipped no more than once. So 1 means the switch is flipped once and 0 means the swtich remains unflipped.
It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.</div>
