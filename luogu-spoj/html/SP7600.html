<h1>MLK - Milk Trading</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Hareedi and Hanadt live in a village with **N** houses built next to each other along one
straight roadway with equal distances between adjacent houses. Some people own cows
and sell the milk their cows produce, while others do not own cows and may need to buy
milk.
Every morning, Hareedi and Hanadi transport milk around the village such that everyone
buys or sells the exact number of bottles they want. Transporting one bottle of milk from
one house to an adjacent house results in one unit of work. **Fortunately**, the number of
milk bottles needed by people is always equal to the number of milk bottles sold by
cow owners.
### Task
write a program that is given the number of milk bottles that people at each house needs
to buy or sell, represented as an integer, finds the minimum work necessary to transport
the bottles from sellers to buyers.
**Constraints**
2 N
-1000 ****B $ _{i} $ **1000** Integer representing the number of bottles to be bought from or****
sold to people at the house at position **i.**
**Input**
- Line 1 contains the integer **N**, the number of houses.
- Each of the next **N** lines contains an integer **B $ _{i} $ . If **B $ _{i} $** > 0 then people in house i are cow**
owners and want **to sell **B $ _{i} $** bottles of milk, If **B $ _{i} $** i are not cow owners**
**and want to buy **B $ _{i} $** bottles of milk.**
**Output**
- A single line containing a single integer, the minimum work units necessary to
transport the bottle of milk.</div>
