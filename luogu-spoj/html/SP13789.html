<h1>LOVINGPW - Loving Power</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Angel Luis is now getting math class. His teacher is teaching to him the XOR operation.
0 XOR 0 = 0
0 XOR 1 = 1
1 XOR 0 = 1
1 XOR 1 = 0
When is a number with more than a bit it operation is made to all bits. The teacher write two number x,y (0<=x<=N and 0<=y<=N) and make the XOR operation betwen x and y, Angel Luis would like to know how many pairs x,y such x XOR y = 2 $ ^{z &nbsp;} $ where z>=0.
See that for N = 3 :
0 XOR 1 = 2 $ ^{0} $
0 XOR 2 = 2 $ ^{1} $
3 XOR 1 = 2 $ ^{1} $
2 XOR 3 = 2 $ ^{0} $
So there is 4 pairs.
Given N you should return how many pair module 1000000007.</div>
