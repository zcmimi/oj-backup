<h1>ANDROUND - AND Rounds</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a cyclic array A having N numbers. In an AND round, each element of the array A is replaced by the bitwise AND of itself, the previous element, and the next element in the array. All operations take place simultaneously. Can you calculate A after K such AND rounds ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line contains the number of test cases T (T <= 50).
There follow 2T lines, 2 per test case. The first line contains two space seperated integers N (3 <= N <= 20000) and K (1 <= K <= 1000000000). The next line contains N space seperated integers Ai (0 <= Ai <= 1000000000), which are the initial values of the elements in array A.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Output T lines, one per test case. For each test case, output a space seperated list of N integers, specifying the contents of array A after K AND rounds.</div>
