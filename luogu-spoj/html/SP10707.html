<h1>COT2 - Count on a tree II</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
给定一个n个节点的树，每个节点表示一个整数，问u到v的路径上有多少个不同的整数。
## 输入格式
第一行有两个整数n和m（n＝40000，m＝100000）。
第二行有n个整数。第i个整数表示第i个节点表示的整数。
在接下来的n-1行中，每行包含两个整数u v，描述一条边（u，v）。
在接下来的m行中，每一行包含两个整数u v，询问u到v的路径上有多少个不同的整数。
## 输出格式
对于每个询问，输出结果。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a tree with **N** nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from **1** to **N**. Each node has an integer weight.
We will ask you to perform the following operation:
- **u v** : ask for how many different integers that represent the weight of nodes there are on the path from **u** to **v**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line there are two integers **N** and **M**. (**N** <= 40000, **M** <= 100000)
In the second line there are **N** integers. The i-th integer denotes the weight of the i-th node.
In the next **N-1** lines, each line contains two integers **u** **v**, which describes an edge (**u**, **v**).
In the next **M** lines, each line contains two integers **u** **v**, which means an operation asking for how many different integers that represent the weight of nodes there are on the path from **u** to **v**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each operation, print its result.</div>
