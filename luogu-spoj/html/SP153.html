<h1>SCALES - Balancing the Stone</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
你有称重的秤，左边有一个已知重量为W的石头。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式：
输入t，测试数据的数量。
对于每一个样例，第一行包含三个整数：N，L，D；N表示砝码的数量，L表示W的二进制长度，D表示模数。第二行包含W的值，该值用0或1表示，无空格，即二进制。
### 输出格式：
对于每个测试数据，输出一行包含一个整数———可能砝码放置方法种数，模D。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given scales for weighing loads. On the left side lies a single stone of known weight W</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line contains three integers: N L D, where N denotes the number of weights at your disposal, L is the length of the binary representation of number W, and D is the modulus (1<= L<= N<= 1000000, 2<= D<=100). The second line contains the value of W, encoded in the binary system as a sequence of exactly L characters 0 or 1 without separating spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case, output a single line containing one integer - the calculated number of possible weight placements, modulo D.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
