<h1>NOVICE63 - Special Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ted thinks that integers having equal number of 1's and 0's in their binary representation are special. Therefore, he wants to know how many such integers are present.
**Note:** For this problem, the binary representation of an integer(>0) is considered from the least significant bit to the last set bit. Which means, 5 has a binary representation of 101, 3 has a binary representation of 11 etc. As such, one example of a special number is 9 which has a binary representation, 1001.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains an integer T(atmost 100) denoting the total number of test cases. Each test case contains a single integer N(2 <= N <= 2^60). N is always a power of 2.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single integer denoting the total number of such special numbers in the range 1 to N (inclusive).</div>
