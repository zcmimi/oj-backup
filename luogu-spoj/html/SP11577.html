<h1>MEDIAN3 - The Famous ICPC Team Again</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>当B先生、G先生和M先生准备2012年ACM-ICPC世界决赛时，B先生收集了大量的比赛问题供他们日常训练。当他们决定接受培训时，B先生会从问题集中选择其中一个。问题集中的所有问题都是根据出版时间来分类的。每次他们的教练，教授都会告诉他们在特定的发布时间间隔内选择一个问题。也就是说，如果在一行中对问题进行了排序，那么每次它们都会从该行的指定段中选择其中一个。
此外，在收集这些问题时，B先生也知道每个问题的难度估计。当他被要求选择一个问题时，如果他选择了最简单的一个，G先生会抱怨：“嘿，多水的问题！”如果他选择最难的一个，M先生会抱怨说要花太多时间来完成它。为了解决这个难题，B先生决定采取中等难度的方案。因此，他需要一种方法来知道序列的给定区间中的中位数。
【输入格式】
对于每个测试用例，第一行包含一个指示问题总数的单个整数n（1＜n<＝100000）。第二行包含n个整数xi
“0<xi < 1000000000”，由单个空间分隔，表示每个问题的困难，已通过发布时间排序。下一行是一个整数M（1 <＝m <＝100000），指定查询数。接下来是m行，每行包含一对整数，A和B(1<=A<=B<=n)，表示B先生需要在位置A和B之间选择一个问题(包括位置从1中计数)。保证A和B之间的项数是奇数。 【输出格式】 对于每一个查询，输出包含一个整数的单行，这表示B先生应该选择的问题的难度。 【简单来说】 就是给你n个数。进行m次询问，每次询问求x到y区间内的中间值，题目保证y-x+1为奇数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>When Mr. B, Mr. G and Mr. M were preparing for the 2012 ACM-ICPC World Final Contest, Mr. B had collected a large set of contest problems for their daily training. When they decided to take training, Mr. B would choose one of them from the problem set. All the problems in the problem set had been sorted by their time of publish. Each time Prof. S, their coach, would tell them to choose one problem within a particular publish time interval. That is to say, if problems had been sorted in a line, each time they will choose one of them from a specified segment of the line.
Moreover, when collecting the problems, Mr. B had also known an estimation of the difficulty of each problem. When he was asked to choose a problem, if he chose the easiest one, Mr. G would complain that “Hey, what a trivial problem!”; if he chose the hardest one, Mr. M would grumble that it took too much time to finish it. For addressing this dilemma, Mr. B decided to take the one with the medium difficulty. Therefore he needed a way to know the median number in the given interval of the sequence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, the first line contains a single integer **n** (1 <= **n** <= 100,000) indicating the total number of problems. The second line contains **n** integers **x $ _{i} $** (0 <= **x $ _{i} $** <= 1,000,000,000), separated by single space, denoting the difficulties of each problem, already sorted by publish time. The next line is a single integer **m** (1 <= **m** <= 100,000), specifying number of queries. Then m lines follow, each line contains a pair of integers, **A** and **B** (1 <= **A** <= **B** <= **n**), denoting that Mr. B needed to choose a problem between positions **A** and **B** (inclusively, positions are counted from 1). It is guaranteed that the number of items between **A** and **B** is odd.</div>
