<h1>SHORTCUT - Shortcut</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目背景
Mirek从家到大学有很多种走法，但他有一条最喜欢的路径，他每天都走这条路去上学
该路线由许多段组成，每段是一条10米长的线。
段要么是前一段的直线的延伸，要么垂直于前一段
Mirek每走过一段后，会休息一会儿来欣赏大自然的美。
他走路时不会经过之前走过的地方
## 题目描述
昨天MiRek在晚会上熬夜画一张样本图，所以他今天起得很晚。
他知道，除非他改变通常的路线，否则他将错过第一堂课。
他计划走一条捷径，且他希望路线尽可能短
（好吧，我们可以秘密告诉你，他不想准时，他只是想安抚他的良心）。
路线必须是连接MiRek家与学校的水平或垂直线段。
请帮Mirek找到最短的路线。
## 任务
编写一个程序：
读入Mirek的路线，计算路线上最短的路径，并写出结果。
## 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
输入从整数T开始，表示测试数据的个数
对于每个测试数据，输入的第一行包含一个整数n（3<=n<=250000），该整数n是路线的区段数。输入的第二行是包含字符n、e、s或w的序列，**在其间没有空格**。每一个字符都是对路线的一个部分的描述。字符N、E、S或W意味着Mirek分别走北、东、南或西10米。保证给定数据至少存在一条捷径。
### 输出格式
输出的第一行和唯一行包含由单个空格分隔的整数L、B、E和字符D。整数L是最短路径的长度（以10米每段测量）。整数b和e是捷径的数目（我们用连续的整数对格点进行编号，Mirek为0，大学为n）。字符D是捷径的方向。如果存在一个以上的最小长度的捷径，则应该输出在路线上最早开始的一条捷径。如果最小长度的多个捷径在同一个格点开始，则应该输出在区域内结束点最远的捷径。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Mirek has a favourite way from home to the university that he traverses every working day. The route consists of sections and each section is a straight segment 10 meters long. Each section is either a straight ahead extension of the previous section or it is perpendicular to the previous section. After traversing each section Mirek takes a small break to admire the beauty of the nature. During his walk he never visits the same place twice.
![A sample map](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP84/5fb4f9ede3f5904d6622bd334cc425e706a64e74.png) Yesterday Mirek stayed up long in the night at the party and today he got up late from bed. He knows that he will miss the first lecture unless he changes his usual route. He plans to make one shortcut but he wants the shortcut to be as short as possible (well, we can tell you in secret that he doesn't want to be on time, he just wants to calm his conscience). The shortcut must be either a horizontal or vertical segment connecting two break points of Mirek's route.
Please help Mirek find the shortest shortcut.
### Task
Write a program that:
- reads Mirek's route,
- computes the shortest shortcut on the route,
- writes the result.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case, the first line of the input contains one integer n (3 <= n <= 250 000) being the number of sections of the route. The second line of the input contains a sequence of n characters N, E, S or W with no spaces in between. Each character is a description of one section of the route. Character N, E, S or W means that Mirek walks 10 meters north, east, south or west respectively. You may assume that at least one shortcut exists for the given route.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first and only line of the output contains integers l, b, e and character d separated by single spaces. Integer l is the length of the shortest shortcut (measured in 10 m segments). Integers b and e are the numbers of break points where the shortcut begins and ends respectively (we number break points with consecutive integers from 0 for Mirek's home to n for the university). Character d is the direction of the shortcut. If more than one shortcut of the minimal length exists you should output the one that begins earliest on the route. If more than one shortcut of the minimal length begins at the same break point you should output the one that ends furthest on the route.</div>
