<h1>TRIOMINO - Triomino Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/TRIOMINO/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/TRIOMINO/vn/) ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2961/42133d51c84789475195b5ab5cf4df9dd7aaec92.png) X and Y are playing the following game: They start with an empty 2xN board and move alternately. X moves first. In a move, a player must place an L-triomino (shown on the right), in any of the 4 possible orientations, on the board. The piece placed must not overlap with a piece that has already been placed. The player that is unable to make a valid move loses.
Given the size of the board, find out who will win the game assuming that both X and Y play optimally</div>
