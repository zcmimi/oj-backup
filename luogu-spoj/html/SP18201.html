<h1>RKS - RK Sorting</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**RK** is a great code breaker. He knows any cipher in the world can be broken by frequency analysis. He intercepted an enemy message. The message consists of **N** numbers, smaller than or equal to **C**. RK belives freqency analysis consists of sorting this sequence so that more frequent numbers appear before less frequent ones.
Formally, the sequence must be sorted so that given any two numbers X and Y , X appears before Y if the number of times X appears in the original sequence is larger than the number of time Y does. If the number of appearances is equal, the number whoes value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.
Help RK by creating a "frequency sorter".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains two integers, N (1 <= N <= 1000), length of message, and C (1 <= C <= 10^9), the number from task description. Next line contains N integers smaller than or equal to C, message itself.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First and only line of output should contain N numbers, the sorted sequence.</div>
