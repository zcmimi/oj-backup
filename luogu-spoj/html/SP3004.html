<h1>LIFEGAME - Life Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are working at a production plant of biological weapons. You are a maintainer of a terrible virus weapon with very high reproductive power. The virus has a tendency to build up regular hexagonal colonies. So as a whole, the virus weapon forms a hexagonal grid, each hexagon being a colony of the virus. The grid itself is in the regular hexagonal form with _N_ colonies on each edge.
The virus self-propagates at a constant speed. Self-propagation is performed simultaneously at all colonies. When it is done, for each colony, the same number of viruses are born at every neighboring colony. Note that, after the self-propagation, if the number of viruses in one colony is more than or equal to the limit density _M_, then the viruses in the colony start self-attacking, and the number reduces modulo _M_.
Your task is to calculate the total number of viruses after _L_ periods, given the size _N_ of the hexagonal grid and the initial number of viruses in each of the colonies.

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of multiple test cases.
Each case begins with a line containing three integers _N_ (1 ≤ _N_ ≤ 6), _M_ (2 ≤ _M_ ≤ 10 $ ^{9} $ ), and _L_ (1 ≤ _L_ ≤ 10 $ ^{9} $ ). The following 2_N_ - 1 lines are the description of the initial state. Each non-negative integer (smaller than _M_) indicates the initial number of viruses in the colony. The first line contains the number of viruses in the _N_ colonies on the topmost row from left to right, and the second line contains those of _N_ + 1 colonies in the next row, and so on.
The end of the input is indicated by a line "0 0 0".</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output the test case number followed by the total number of viruses in all colonies after _L_ periods.</div>
