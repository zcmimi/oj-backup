<h1>PRO - Promotion</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一家大型的超市连锁店要求你写一个模拟促销费用的程序。
推广必须遵循以下规则：
一个想参加促销活动的顾客，在收据上写下自己的个人资料，并把它投到一个特殊的投票箱里。
在晋升的每一天结束时，从投票箱里拿出两张账单：
首先，选择金额最大的收据，
然后选择金额最小的收据；
支付金额最大的客户将获得一笔奖金，奖金金额等于其账单上金额与账单上金额之差，即金额最小的金额。
为了避免一次购买的多个奖项，根据上述规则选择的两张账单都不会返回到投票箱，但是所有剩余的票据仍然参与促销。
超市的营业额很大，因此可以作出假设，即在每天结束之前，拿出最大金额和最小金额的收据，在票箱中至少有2张收据。
你的任务是计算（基于关于在促销的每一天扔进投票箱的价格的信息），在整个促销过程中，奖金的总成本是多少。
编写一个程序，从标准输入中读取在促销的每一天投入到投票箱中的收据的价格列表，计算在连续的促销日内支付的奖金的总成本，然后将结果写入标准输出。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A large Bytelandian supermarket chain has asked you to write a program for the simulating costs of a promotion being prepared.
The promotion has to follow the following rules:
- A customer who wants to participate in the promotion, writes on the receipt, paid by himself, his personal details and throws it into a special ballot box.
- At the end of every day of the promotion, two bills are taken out from the ballot box:
- first, the receipt amounting to the largest sum is chosen,
- then the receipt amounting to the smallest sum is chosen;
The customer who has paid the largest sum gets a money prize equal to the difference between the sum on his bill and the sum on the bill amounting to the smallest sum.
- To avoid multiple prizes for one purchase, both bills selected according to the above rules are not returned to the ballot box, but all remaining bills still participate in the promotion.
The turnover of the supermarket is very big, thus an assumption can be made, that at the end of every day, before taking out receipts amounting to the largest and the smallest sum, there are at least 2 receipts in the ballot box.
Your task is to compute (on the basis of information about prices on receipts thrown into the ballot box on each day of promotion) what the total cost of prizes during the whole promotion will be.
Write a program, which: reads from the standard input a list of prices on receipts thrown into the ballot box on each day of the promotion, computes the total cost of prizes paid in consecutive days of promotion, then writes the result to the standard output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains one positive integer n (1 <= n <= 5000), which is the duration of promotion in days. Each of the next n lines consists of a sequence of non-negative integers separated by single spaces. Numbers in the (i+1)-th line of the file represent prices on receipts thrown into the ballot box on the i-th day of promotion. The first integer in the line is k, 0 <= k <= 10^5, the number of receipts on the day, and the next k numbers are positive integers standing for the sums on receipts; none of these numbers is larger than 10^6.
The total number of bills thrown into the ballot box during the whole promotion does not exceed 10^6.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output should contain exactly one integer, equal to the total cost of prizes paid during the whole promotion.</div>
