<h1>DPAIR - Counting d-pairs</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You're given a sequence A of N non-negative integers. Answer Q queries, where each query consists of two integers: a, b. The answer is number of pairs of integers i and j that satisfy these three conditions:
(1) 1 <= i <= j <= N
(2) a <= j-i+1 <= b
(3) all elements of A with indices from range \[i, j\] are mutually distinct. (indexing starts with 1)
**Constraints** :
1 <= N <= 8\*10^5
1 <= Q <= 2\*10^5
0 <= A\[k\] <= 10^6, for every integer k between 1 and N, inclusive
1 <= a <= b <= N</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains integer N. Second line contains N integers representing sequence A. Third line is integer Q, number of queries. Next Q lines have 2 integers, a and b.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the i-th line output the answer for i-th query.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
