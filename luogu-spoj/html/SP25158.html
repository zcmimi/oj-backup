<h1>STARSBC - Star</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Fernando生日的时候得到了一个圆规，而且他现在最喜欢的爱好时画星星。所以，他在一个圆上标记了N个点，且这几个点把圆分成了N段相等的弧。然后，他将每个点连接至第k个点的下一个点，直至回到第一个点。
根据k的值，Fernando有可能到得了之前圆周长上标记的所有的点，也有可能到不了。如果可以到所有标记过的点，那我们认为这是一个完整的星。例如，n=8时，星有可能如下图所示。那么，星（a）和星（c）是完整的，而星（b）和星（d）不是完整的。
输入有多组数据。每行有一个整数N(3 N < 2 ^31 )，表示弧的个数。
对于每次询问，每行输出一个整数，表示可绘制完整的星的个数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fernando won a compass for his birthday, and now his favorite hobby is drawing stars: ﬁrst, he marks **N** points on a circumference, dividing it into **N** equal arcs; then, he connects each point to the _k-th_ next point, until returning to the ﬁrst point.
Depending on the value of _k_, Fernando may or may not reach all points marked on the circumference; when that happens, the star is called complete. For example, when **N** = 8, the possible stars are shown in the ﬁgure below. Stars (a) and (c) are complete, while stars (b) and (d) are not.
![Stars for N=8 and k in {1-4}](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP25158/1c87a031cb5d728512d67c9e5c7626fa6db689ea.png)
Depending on the value of **N**, it may be possible to draw many diﬀerent stars; Fernando asked you to write a program that, given **N**, determines the number of complete stars he can draw.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a single line, containing a single integer **N** (3 N < 2 $ ^{31} $ ), indicating the number of arcs in which the circumference was divided.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, your program must print a single line containing a single integer, indicating the number of complete stars that can be drawn.</div>
