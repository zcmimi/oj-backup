<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two integers a and b find their greatest common divisor.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains number 0 < n < 1000 the amount of tests. The description of n test cases follow. The description of a test case consists of two lines. The first line contains integer a (0 < a < 10^12540), the second – integer b (0 < b < 10^12540). It is also known that all the numbers in the input file are the determinants of the square matrix of the form:
