<h1>UCI2009B - Binomial Coefficients</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We all got too excited when we learned (A + B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2. After solving this problem, maybe you could get even more excited because you will have to calculate (A + B)^N, where (0 <= N <= 1000).
Follow the rules below when giving the answer:
1. Consecutive terms must be separated by a '+' character.
2. At the i-th term, A must be raised to N - i and B must be raised to i (0<=i<=N).
3. Binomial coefficients must not be printed, print their prime factorization instead.
4. Use '^' for exponentiation and 'x' for multiplication in step 3.
5. Avoid the use of number 1 when possible.
See sample output for clarification.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input starts with an integer T, representing the number of test cases (1<=T<=15). T lines follow, each one consisting of an integer N, (0<=N<=1000).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print (A + B)^N, on a single line.</div>
