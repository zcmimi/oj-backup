<h1>TCOUNT3 - Counting Triangles III</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Have you felt bored when counting triangles?**
Like TRICOUNT and TCOUNT2, we define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP1731/c8edf80b02c0246e6d8c8bf8821d8da784b7a23f.png)
And now we will continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagram. It's called level N hexagram if it’s joined by 12 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.

**Task:** All you have to do is to count all triangles in the level N hexagram.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the hexagram in that test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles in the level N hexagram. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit positive integer)</div>
