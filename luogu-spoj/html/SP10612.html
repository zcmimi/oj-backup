<h1>FUNAREA - Funny Areas</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There is an M x N matrix of integer numbers. Both the rows and columns of the matrix are numbered starting at 0 and ending at M-1 and N-1 respectively.
A funny area is defined by three integers i,j, and r, and it is composed for those cells \[x,y\] such that |i-x| + |j-y| <= r. As you might have probably guessed **\[i,j\]** is the center and **r** is the radius of the funny area.
In this problem we are interested in finding the sum of every cell inside some given funny areas.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers 1 <= M, N <= 1000 representing the rows and columns of the matrix.
Each of the following M lines contains N integers separated by single spaces. These numbers are non-negative and not greater than 1,000,000,000
The next line contains a number F (1 <= F <= 100,000) which is the number of funny areas.
Each of the following F lines contains three integers **i**,**j**, and **r** representing the center and the radius of a funny area.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>F lines: for each funny area print a single number -- the sum of all the cells inside of it.</div>
