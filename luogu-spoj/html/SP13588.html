<h1>ONEXLIS - One X LIS</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For a given sequence a\[1\], a\[2\], ... a\[n\], lets call a subsequence a\[k $ _{1} $ \], ...a\[k $ _{i} $ \]... a\[k $ _{m} $ \] (where 1<=k $ _{i} $ <=n and k $ _{i} $ <k $ _{i+1} $ ) as **"one X increasing subsequence**" if there is exactly one i between 1 and m-1 (inclusive) for which a\[k $ _{i} $ \]>a\[k $ _{i+1} $ \]. Given a sequence find the length of the longest "one X increasing subsequence".</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains t, which denotes the number of test cases. 2\*T lines follow. Each test case is described using 2 lines.
First line of a test case contains an integer- n, which denotes the number of elements in the array.
Second lines contains n integers, which represent a\[i\] 1<=i<=n.
1<=t<=20
1<=n<=100000
1<=a\[i\]<=10^9</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print one integer which represents the number of integers in the One X LIS. The output for each test case should be printed on a new line.</div>
