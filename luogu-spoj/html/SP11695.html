<h1>ASUMHARD - A Summatory (HARD)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>f(n) is defined as: f(n) = 1 $ ^{k} $ +2 $ ^{k} $ +3 $ ^{k} $ +...+n $ ^{k} $ , so it is the sum of the k-th power of all natural numbers up to n.
In this problem you are about to compute,
f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ... + f(n)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is an integer **T**(1 T T test cases follow.
For each test case, there are two integers **n**(1 n k(0 k</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output the result of the summatory function described above.
Since this number could be very large, output the answer modulo 1,234,567,891.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
