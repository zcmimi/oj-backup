<h1>RSHIFT - Right Shift</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>All the numbers in a computer is represented as 64-bit 2's complement form.
You have to write a program to perform the following task :-
- Read the number (given in decimal form).
- Shift all the bits towards right (the first bit is removed), i.e the second bit from right is shifted to first position, third to second and so on.
- Add a zero to the last position.
- Write the result back in decimal form
For example 10 is represented as:
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1010
After step 2 the result is:
\_000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101
After step 3 the result is:
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0101
Finally the output is: 5</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains **T** representing the number of test cases (T<=500000). Then T lines follows each containing a input number.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print T lines, each containing the result of each test case.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
