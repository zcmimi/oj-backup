<h1>PT07A - Play with a Tree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Hey, ACRush and Jelly are playing a game ! Let take a look at its rule:
You are given a tree. Two players take turns cutting edges on a tree. Some nodes is on the "ground". When a player cuts an edge, all the edges that are no longer connected to the ground disappear. The player who can not take a move loses.
ACRush plays first. Both of them are very good players. If you know state of the tree they are playing with, can you guess who will win?
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP1477/feb027943b86a4264abe2241ae184c0d7007eb0e.png) Node 4 is on the ground.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Input consists of multiple test-cases. The first line contains one integer _t_ - number of cases (0 < _t_ <= 20). For each case, the input format is following. The first line contains one integer _N_ (1 <= _N_ <= 100000). The next line _N_ integers s\[i\] (1 or 0). If s\[i\] is 1, the _i_-th node is on the ground. If s\[i\] is 0, the _i_-th node is not on the ground. Each line of the following _N_ - 1 lines contains two integers u, v. They denote there is an edge between node u and node v (1 <= u,v <= N).
There is no blank line after each case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each case, output who will win the game. If ACRush wins, output _1_; otherwise, output 0 (Jelly wins).
There is no blank line after each case.</div>
