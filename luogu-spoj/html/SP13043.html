<h1>AMR12D - The Mirror of Galadriel</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>如果S的每个子串都出现在Galadriel的Mirror中（在横向反转下），我们将字符串S称为魔术。换句话说，魔术字符串是一个字符串，其中每个子字符串在其字符串中都有其相反的字符。
给定字符串S，确定它是否具有魔力。
输入格式
第一行包含T，即测试用例的数量。接下来的T行各包含一个字符串。
输出格式
对于每个测试用例，如果字符串是魔术符，则输出“ YES”，否则输出“ NO”。
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and breathed on it, and when the water was still again she spoke. 'Here is the Mirror of Galadriel,' she said. 'I have brought you here so that you may look in it, if you will. For this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel. Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?' - Galadriel to Frodo and Sam, describing her Mirror.
We call a string S magical if every substring of S appears in Galadriel's Mirror (under lateral inversion). In other words, a magical string is a string where every substring has its reverse in the string.
Given a string S, determine if it is magical or not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains T, the number of test cases. The next T lines contain a string each.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output "YES" if the string is magical, and "NO" otherwise.</div>
