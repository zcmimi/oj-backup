<h1>CEQU - Crucial Equation</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let us see the following equation,
_**ax+by=c**_
Given three positive integers **a**, **b** and **c**. You have to determine whether there exists at least one solution for some integers value of **x** and **y** where **x**, **y** may be negative or non-negative integers.
For example if **a=2**, **b=4** and **c=8** then the equation will be **2x+4y=8**, and hence, for **x=2** and **y=1**, there exists a solution.
Let us see another example for **a=3**, **b=6** and **c=7**, so the equation will become **3x+6y=7** and there exists no solution satisfying this equation.
**Input**
Input starts with an integer **T (1<=T<=10 $ ^{5} $ )** denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains three integers **a**, **b**, and **c**. **(1<=a, b, c<=10 $ ^{6} $ )**.
**Output**
For each test case of input print the case number and “**Yes**” if there exists at least one solution, print “**No**” otherwise.
**Sample Input**
