<h1>MAIN112 - Re-Arrange II</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For a sequence of N integers, A1, A2, ..... AN
We can calculate the stability factor P, as
P = sum of all (abs(A $ _{i} $ -A $ _{i-1} $ )\*C\[i\]) where 2 <= i <= N
C\[i\] is the cost of putting a number at position i
Your task is find the minimum P for the given N numbers considering all the different permutations of them.
**Input**
First line contains an integer T(1<=T<=10) which denotes the total number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines.
The first line contains the integer N(1<=N<=15). The second line contains a space separated list of N integers(<150) which denote the given set of numbers.
The third line contains a space separated list of N integers. The ith integer on this line denotes the value for C\[i\](1 <= C\[i\] < 150)</div>
