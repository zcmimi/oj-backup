<h1>EBOXES - Empty Boxes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**N** large empty boxes (assume they are of type:1) are initially placed on a table. An unknown number of boxes (type:1) are selected and in each of them **K** smaller boxes (type:2) are placed. Again an unknown number of type:2 boxes are selected and **K** boxes of type:3 are placed inside. This process is repeated **T** times. Now a box is assumed to be empty when it has no smaller boxes inside it. Finally after all the processes are complete let there be **F** empty boxes in total.</div>
