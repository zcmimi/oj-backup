<h1>REGPOLYG - Regular Convex Polygon</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A regular convex polygon is a polygon where each side has the same length, and all interior angles are equal and less than 180 degrees. A square, for example, is a regular convex polygon. You are given three points which are vertices of a regular convex polygon _R_; can you determine the minimum number of vertices that _R_ must have?
**Input**
Each test case consists of three lines. Line _i_ consists of two floating point values _x_ $ _{i} $ and _y_ $ _{i} $ (−10 $ ^{4} $ x $ _{1} $ , _y_ $ _{1} $ x $ _{i} $ , _y_ $ _{i} $ ) are the coordinates of a vertex of _R_. The coordinates are given with a precision of 10 $ ^{&minus;6} $ , i.e., they differ from the exact coordinates by at most 10 $ ^{&minus;6} $ . You may assume that for each test case the Euclidean distance between any two given points is at least 1, and _R_ has at most 1000 vertices. The input will finish with a line containing the word END.
**Output**
For each test case, print one line with the minimum number of vertices that _R_ must have.
**Sample Input**
