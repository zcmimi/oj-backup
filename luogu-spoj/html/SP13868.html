<h1>NITTROAD - Roads of NITT</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Institute of NITT believes in frugality. So when they made the plan for interconnecting the N hostels, they decided to construct as few bidirectional roads as possible. The hostels are interconnected with roads in such a way that every pair of hostels is connected by exactly one path.</div>
