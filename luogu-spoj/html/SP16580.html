<h1>QTREE7 - Query on a tree VII</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一棵树,每个点初始有个点权和颜色(输入会给你)
$0$ $u$ :询问所有$u,v$ 路径上的最大点权,要满足$u,v$ 路径上所有点的颜色都相同
$1$ $u$ :反转$u$ 的颜色
$2$ $u$ $w$ :把$u$ 的点权改成$w$
$color_i\in[0,1],w_i\in[-10^9,10^9],n,m\le10^5$
感谢@Kelin 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with n nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to **n**. Each node has a color, white or black, and a weight. We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:
- **0 u**: ask for the maximum weight among the nodes which are connected to **u**, two nodes are connected if all the node on the path from **u** to **v** (inclusive **u** and **v**) have a same color.
- **1 u**: toggle the color of **u**(that is, from black to white, or from white to black).
- **2 u w**: change the weight of **u** to **w**.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a number **n** denoted how many nodes in the tree(1 n n-1 lines, each line has two numbers (**u**, **v**) describe a edge of the tree(1 u, **v** n number, the first line is the initial color of each node(0 or 1), and the second line is the initial weight, let's say Wi, of each node(|**Wi**| m denoted how many operations we are going to process(1 m m lines, each line describe a operation (**t**, **u**) as we mentioned above(0 t u n, |**w**|</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
