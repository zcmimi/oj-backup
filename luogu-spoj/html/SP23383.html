<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>1. **1.** **Introduction
Definition :** An **isomorphism** from a simple graph G to a simple graph H is a bijection f:V(G) -> V(H) such that uv belongs to E(G) if and only if f(u)f(v) belongs to E(H) . We say “G is **isomorphic to** H”, if there is an isomorphism from G to H.
**Example :** The following two graphs are isomorphic.

G $ _{1} $ G $ _{2} $
Our objective in this problem is to find isomorphic graphs.</div>

<div>An isomorphic class is simply a list of graphs which belong to it. And Output is written to STDOUT.
The output should follow the below format:
1\. Output is a listing of all isomorphic classes, one on each line, sorted in ascending order by the first
graph of the class.
2\. Within an isomorphic class, the members are printed in ascending order.
(Thus, the class containing graph ‘1’ is always on line 1.)</div>
