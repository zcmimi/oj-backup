<h1>SUMFOUR - 4 values whose sum is 0</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给定4个数列A,B,C,D。要从每个数列中取出1个数，使4个数的和为0。求出这样的组合个数。当一个数列中有多个相同的数字时，把他们作为不同的数字看待。
输入：
第一行：n
以下n行，每行4个数，第i行为ai,bi,ci,di。
输出：
组合数个数。
限制：
n<=4000;
|ai,bi,ci,di|<=2^28
</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The SUM problem can be formulated as follows: given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many quadruplet (a, b, c, d ) belongs to A x B x C x D are such that a + b + c + d = 0 . In the following, we assume that all lists have the same size n</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input file contains the size of the lists n (this value can be as large as 4000). We then have n lines containing four integer values (with absolute value as large as 2 $ ^{28} $ ) that belong respectively to A, B, C and D .
(**Edited:** n <= 2500)</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output should be printed on a single line.</div>
