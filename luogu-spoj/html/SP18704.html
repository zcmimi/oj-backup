<h1>TRITILE - Triangle Tiling</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Problem Statement**
Var is trying to find a new geometric shape with an even number of sides. She starts with an equilateral triangle and performs a series of n steps. At each step she adds an equilateral triangle to the outer sides of the shape she already has. Can you tell, if after n steps, her new shape will have even number of sides or not?
**Input**
First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, denoting the total number of steps she performs.
**Output**
Print “Yes” if she ends up with a shape that has even number of sides, or print “No”.
**Constraints**
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= n <= 10 ^ 18
**Sample Input**
1
1
**Sample Output**
No
**Explanation**
