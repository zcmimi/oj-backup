<h1>ACPC10D - Tri graphs</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Here’s a simple graph problem: Find the shortest path from the top-middle vertex to the bottom-middle vertex in a given tri-graph. A tri-graph is an acyclic graph of (N >= 2) rows and exactly 3 columns. Unlike regular graphs, the costs in a tri-graph are associated with the vertices rather than the edges.
![a](../../../content/omar_azazy:ACPC10D "a")
So, considering the example with N = 4, the cost of going straight down from the top to bottom along the middle vertices is 7 + 13 + 3 + 6 = 29. The layout of the directional edges in the graph are always the same as illustrated in the figure.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.
Each test case is specified using N + 1 lines where the first line specifies a single integer (2 The last case is followed by a line with a single zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print the following line:
k. n
Where k is the test case number (starting at one,) and n is the least cost to go from the top-middle vertex to the bottom-middle vertex.</div>
