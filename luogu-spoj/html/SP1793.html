<h1>GEN2 - Text Generater II</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[HL](http://www.spoj.com/users/g201513), [HJ](http://www.spoj.com/users/lcosvse) and [FGD](http://www.spoj.com/users/xilinx) set problem for [ZMY](http://www.spoj.com/users/zmy) everyday. The title of each problem bores them very much. The title is a string which consists only lower case letters. It's length is _L_, and, of course, the title must contain their names(hl, hj, fgd) as consecutive substrings.More apparently, _N_ evil consecutive substrings should not appear in the title. Any string satisfying the two conditions above is OK.
The task ZMY is to do today is: if they give ZMY 8 problems every week, and the title of each problem should not be repeated, how many (complete) weeks can they set problems?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases.Input terminates by EOF.
For each test case:
The first line contains two space-seperated integers L(0<=L<=10 $ ^{9} $ ) and N(0<=N<=20). N lines follow, each contains a string (contains only lowercase letters), which is evil.You can assume the total length of the N evil strings is no more than 20.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output one line contains the answer modudo 1000.</div>
