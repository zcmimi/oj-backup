<h1>CSUBSEQS - Common Subsequences</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>有四个字符串，每个字符串最多包含$50$个小写字母$(a-z)$。
你需要计算它们的**非空**的公共子序列的数量（所有4个字符串的子序列）。请注意，子序列不必是连续的。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given four strings, each consisting of at most 50 lower case letters ('a'-'z'). Count the number of non-empty common subsequences of them (the number of distinct non-empty strings which are subsequences of all four strings). Note that a subsequence does not have to be contiguous.</div>
