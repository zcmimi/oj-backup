<h1>GAMES - HOW MANY GAMES</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>**Problem Statement:**
A player has played unknown number of games. We know the average score of the player (sum of scores in all the games / no. of games). Find the minimum number of games the player should have played to achieve that average.
The player can score any non-negative integer score in a game.
**Input:**
The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single [Rational Number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_number) which represents the average score of the player.
**Output:**
For each test case, find the minimum number of matches the player should have played to achieve that average.
**Input Constraints:**
1 <= t <= 1000
1 <= avg <= 1000000 (maximum 4 digits after the decimal place)
**Example:**
```
Sample Input:
3
5
5.5
30.25
Sample Output:
