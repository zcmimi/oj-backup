<h1>HMRO - Help the Military Recruitment Office!</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>在2004年底，波兰军事招募办公室的区域机构（称为波兰的WKU）向1984年出生的所有男孩发出了一个电话。每个新兵都有他个人的11位数识别号码（PIESL，格式：YYMMDDXXXX，YYMMD是出生日期，XXXXX是小于100000的零填充整数）。每个征兵办公室都有自己的代码（MRO，格式化：一个由3个大写字母和一个数字组成的地方代码）。但今年军队进行了一些改革，并不是所有征兵年龄的男孩都将被招募。关闭MRO点的列表如下：关闭MRO的代码后面是一些其他MRO的代码，所有新兵现在都将被分配。新兵名单包含他们的佩塞尔代码。你的任务是准备完整的新兵名单并确定他们新的MRO-S的代码。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> At the end of year 2004, the regional agencies of the Polish Military Recruitment Office (known as WKU in Polish) is sending a call to all boys born in 1984. Every recruit has his personal 11-digit identification number (PESEL, format: YYMMDDXXXXX, where YYMMDD is the date of birth, and XXXXX is a zero-padded integer smaller than 100000). Every agency of the Military Recruitment Office has its own code (MRO, format: a place code consisting of 3 upper case letters and a one-digit number). But this year the army underwent some reforms and not all boys at conscription age are going to be recruited. The list of closed down MRO points is as follows: the code of the closed down MRO is followed by the code of some other MRO, to which all the recruits are now going to be assigned. The list of recruits contains their PESEL codes. Your task is to prepare the complete list of recruits and determine the codes of their new MRO-s.</div>
