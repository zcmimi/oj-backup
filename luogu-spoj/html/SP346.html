<h1>COINS - Bytelandian gold coins</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
Byteland有一个非常奇怪的货币体系。
每个Bytelandian金币上都写有一个整数。
一枚金币可以在银行兑换成三枚硬币：n/2，n/3和n/4。
这些数字都要向下取整（如果向上取整的话那银行就不能盈利了啊）。
你也可以拿Bytelandian硬币去换美元，汇率是1：1。
但是你不能拿美元换Bytelandian硬币。
如果你有一个金币，那么你最多可以换到多少美元？
输入输出格式
输入格式：
输入有多组数据（不超过10个）。
每组数据都只有一行且仅只有一个数字，是金币上写的数字n，范围：0<=n<=1 000 000 000。
输出格式： 对于每组数据输出你最多能换来的美元(一行一个)。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> In Byteland they have a very strange monetary system.
Each Bytelandian gold coin has an integer number written on it. A coin n can be exchanged in a bank into three coins: n/2, n/3 and n/4. But these numbers are all rounded down (the banks have to make a profit).
You can also sell Bytelandian coins for American dollars. The exchange rate is 1:1. But you can not buy Bytelandian coins.
You have one gold coin. What is the maximum amount of American dollars you can get for it?</div>
