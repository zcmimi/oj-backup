<h1>CHAMPS - Michel and the championship</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Michel is participating in a championship where each participant have p $ _{i} $ (0<=i<=N-1) points. He knows for some pairs of participants an inequality between the points of each one, in the form p $ _{A} $ -p $ _{B} $ >= C. Now he wants to know if his data is correct, i.e., if its possible to assign points for each participant and satisfy all the inequalities.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input consists of several test cases (at most 150). The first line of each test case consists of two integers N and M (1<=N<=500, 0<=M<=5000). Then follow M lines of three integers A, B and C, indicating that p $ _{A} $ -p $ _{B} $ >= C (0<=A,B<=N-1, |C|<=20000).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single line for each test case with 'y' if the data is valid or 'n' if its not.</div>
