<h1>SELFDESN - Self Descriptive Number</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A positive integer _m_ is called "self-descriptive" in base _b_, where _b_>=2 and _b_ is an integer, if:
i) The representation of _m_ in base _b_ is of the form (a $ _{0} $ a $ _{1} $ ...a $ _{b-1} $ ) $ _{b} $
> (that is _m_=a $ _{0} $ b $ ^{b-1} $ +a $ _{1} $ b $ ^{b-2} $ +...+a $ _{b-2} $ b+a $ _{b-1} $ , where 0
ii) a $ _{i} $ is equal to the number of occurences of number i in the sequence (a $ _{0} $ a $ _{1} $ ...a $ _{b-1} $ ).
For example, (21200) $ _{5} $ is "self-descriptive" in base 5, because it has five digits and contains two 0s, one 1s, two 2s, and no (3s and 4s).
(21200) $ _{5} $ = (1425) $ _{10} $ so 1425 is "self-descriptive" number.
Given **n**(1 n m (1 m n-th smallest "self-descriptive" number.</div>
