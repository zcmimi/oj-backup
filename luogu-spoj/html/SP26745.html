<h1>SERGRID - Grid</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are on an nxm grid where each square on the grid has a digit on it. From a given square that has digit k on it, a Move consists of jumping exactly k squares in one of the four cardinal directions. A move cannot go beyond the edges of the grid; it does not wrap. What is the minimum number of moves required to get from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single integer on a line by itself representing the minimum number of moves required to get from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right. If it isn’t possible, output -1.</div>
