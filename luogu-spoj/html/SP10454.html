<h1>GREENLAN - Greens Land</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mr. Green has a large portion of land divided into square units that are either field or lake areas.
He wants to fence a rectangular portion of his lands to use for livestock.
The lake areas have a very soft soil and any fence built near those areas have a chance to fall (and
then the animals could escape), so no fence should be built near a lake area.
![Green's Land](http://www.students.ic.unicamp.br/~ra093887/greens_land.png)
Mr. Green wants to know of how many ways he can fence a rectangular area of his lands without
any portion of the fence having a common border with a lake area.
In the example above, for a 3x3 land with a lake area in the center, we have 5 possibilities of fence.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:
One line with a integer N (1 N lines, each with N characters. Each character is either ‘.’ or ‘X’. The j − th character on the
i − th line is a ‘X’ if position (i, j) is a lake area, and ‘.’ if it is a field area.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a line with the number of different valid ways wich Mr. Green can fence his
lands.</div>
