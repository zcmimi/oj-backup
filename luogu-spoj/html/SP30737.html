<h1>ADAHW - Ada and Homework</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug came home with difficult homework. Since she is very skilled mathematician, she already deduced, how to count the answer for N. Consider all numbers **K**(in range **2 ), for which it is true that _gcd(N,K)==1_ and add _gcd(N,K-1)_ to sum. What is the sum?**
A little bit more formally, find: ∑ gcd(K-1,N), for K ∈ \[2,N\] where gcd(N,K)==1
Anyway the numbers are too large, so she can't do that without your help. Can you help her?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains **1 , number of test-cases.**
Each of following **T** lines contains **2 , number for which ada wants the answer.**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print the sum of deduced formula.</div>
