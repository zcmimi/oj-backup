<h1>AE5A2 - Quasi-template</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A template of a word v is such a word s that all occurrences of s within v cover the whole word v (i.e. each letter of the word v appears within some fragment of consecutive letters of v equal to s). By quasi-template of a word v we mean such a word s that s is a substring (i.e. a fragment of consecutive letters) of v and s is a template of some superstring of v. The figure below shows why the word aabaa is a quasi-template of the word aaaabaabaaaba:
![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP4311/1cd1ac05b16bf5a95618d4f3edd95d5cef2a2d11.png)For a given word v we would like to compute the number of its quasi-templates and the shortest one of them.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The only line of the standard input contains a non-empty word v that is not longer than 200000 letters. It consists of small letters of English alphabet.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the standard output should contain the number of quasi-templates of word v. The second line should contain the shortest word being a quasi-template of word v. If there is more than one such shortest word, output the lexicographically smallest from the shortest quasi-templates.</div>
