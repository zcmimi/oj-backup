<h1>MYQ10 - Mirror Number</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求[a,b]中**镜像回文**的个数。
**镜像回文**是指上下对称，左右对称的数字。
显然：镜像回文由**0,1,8**构成。
0 <= a<=b <= 10^44</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A number is called a Mirror number if on lateral inversion, it gives the same number i.e it looks the same in a mirror. For example 101 is a mirror number while 100 is not.
Given two numbers a and b, find the number of mirror numbers in between them (inclusive of a and b).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T, number of testcases <= 10^5.
Each testcase is described in a single line containing two numbers a and b.
0 <= a<=b <= 10^44</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print the number of mirror numbers between a and b in a single line.</div>
