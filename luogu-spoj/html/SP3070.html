<h1>SEQ5 - How many subsequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Tom has again maths , and the teacher writes countless tables with exercises .... so boring. Then he remembers an old problem of informatics that he thought in a dream . He remembered , he has a number of positive integers and the job was to know how many subsequences that have between L and U distinct elements exist in that range. So the boring hour will pass quicker . But he needs your help , he is to exhausted after two hours of math with the agitated teacher .</div>
