<h1>PRETTY - Pretty Functions</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}.
For a given positive integer K, the function f : S --> S is called "pretty" if, for every X in S, it holds that
f ( f ( f ( ... f ( X ) ... ) ) ) = X, where f is repeated exactly K times.
How many pretty functions are there, modulo M?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
