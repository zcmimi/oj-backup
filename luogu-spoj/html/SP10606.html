<h1>BALNUM - Balanced Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一个数被称为是平衡的数当且仅当对于所有出现过的数位，偶数出现奇数次，奇数出现偶数次。给定A,B，请统计出[A，B]内所有平衡数的个数。
1<=A<=B<=10^19</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Balanced numbers have been used by mathematicians for centuries. A positive integer is considered a balanced number if:
1\) Every **even** digit appears an **odd** number of times in its decimal representation
2\) Every **odd** digit appears an **even** number of times in its decimal representation
For example, 77, 211, 6222 and 112334445555677 are balanced numbers while 351, 21, and 662 are not.
Given an interval \[A, B\], your task is to find the amount of balanced numbers in \[A, B\] where both **A and B are included.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases.
A test case consists of two numbers A and B separated by a single space representing the interval. You may assume that 1 <= A <= B <= 10 $ ^{19} $</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you need to write a number in a single line: the amount of balanced numbers in the corresponding interval</div>
