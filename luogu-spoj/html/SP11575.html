<h1>EQ2 - A Famous Equation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
B老师下课后在黑板上写了一个加法的方程，比如123+321=444。G先生去掉了一些数字，让它看起来像“1?3+??1=44?”。当B先生发觉到一些数字被擦掉后，他想把它们重新写上。可是，重写方程的方法可能不止一种。例如，“1?3+??1=44”可以恢复为“123+321-444”或“143+301-444”以及许多其他的方程。现在让你来确定可能的解决方案的数量。
### 输入格式
每一个输入数据包含一个方程，如a+b=c，其中保证包含一个加号+和一个等号=，其中一些数用‘？’来替换。您可以假定a、b和c均为非负整数，并且每个数字的长度<=9。也就是说，这个方程将包含三个小于1,000,000,0000的整数
### 输出格式
对于每个输入数据，输出一行样例编号和可能的解的数量</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mr. B wrote an addition equation such as 123+321=444 on the blackboard after class. Mr. G removes some of the digits and makes it look like “1?3+??1=44?”. After Mr. B realizes some digits are missing, he wants to recover them. Unfortunately, there may be more than one way to recover the equation. For example “1?3+??1=44?” can be recovered to “123+321=444” or “143+301=444” and many other possible solutions. Your job is to determine the number of different possible solutions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each test case describes a single line with an equation like **a+b=c** which contains exactly one plus sign **+** and one equal sign **=** with some digits are missing and replaced with **?**. You may assume **a**, **b** and **c** are non-negative integers, and the length of each number is no more than 9. In the other words, the equation will contain three integers less than 1,000,000,000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, display a single line with its case number and the number of possible solutions to recover the equation.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>7+1?=1?
?1+?1=22</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Case 1: 3
Case 2: 1</code></pre>
