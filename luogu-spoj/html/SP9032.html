<h1>CUBEFR - Cube Free Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> A cube free number is a number who’s none of the divisor is a cube number (A cube number is a cube of a integer like 8 (2 \* 2 \* 2) , 27 (3 \* 3 \* 3) ). So cube free numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 etc (we will consider 1 as cube free). 8, 16, 24, 27, 32 etc are not cube free number. So the position of 1 among the cube free numbers is 1, position of 2 is 2, 3 is 3 and position of 10 is 9. Given a positive number you have to say if its a cube free number and if yes then tell its position among cube free numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of the test case will be the number of test case T (1 <= T <= 100000) . Then T lines follows. On each line you will find a integer number n (1 <= n <= 1000000).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input line, print a line containing “Case I: ”, where I is the test case number. Then if it is not a cube free number then print “Not Cube Free”. Otherwise print its position among the cube free numbers.</div>
