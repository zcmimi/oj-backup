<h1>TFSETS - Triple-Free Sets</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> A set **S** of positive integers is called _strongly triple-free_ if, for any integer **x**, the sets {**x**, 2**x**} and {**x**, 3**x**} are not subsets of **S**. Let's define **F(n)** as a number of strongly triple-free subsets of {1, 2, ..., **n**}, where **n** is a natural number.
You need to write a program which being given a number **n** calculates the number **F(n)** modulo 1 000 000 001.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input contains integer **T** (1 ≤ **T** ≤ 500) - the number of testcases. Then descriptions of **T** testcases follow.
The description of the testcase consists of one line. The line contains an integer number **n** (1 ≤ **n** ≤ 100 000).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each testcase in the input your program should output one line. This line should contain one integer number which is the number **F(n)** modulo 1 000 000 001.</div>
