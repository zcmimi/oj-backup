Corresponding subsequence means indices chosen in both of the lists must be the same.
**Input format:**
The first line contains an integer **T** , the number of test cases.
Then for each test cases, there are 3 lines.
The first line has an integer N, the number of elements in the lists A& B.
The second line contains N integers of the list A.
The third line contains N integers of the list B.
**Output format:**
For each test case, print the answer in a single line.
**Constraints:**
1 < T < 50
