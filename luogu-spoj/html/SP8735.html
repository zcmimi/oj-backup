<h1>CUBEND - Suffix Of Cube</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given any string of decimal digits, ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, there is always a decimal
number, which when cubed has a decimal expansion ending in the original given digit
string. The number need never have more digits than the given digit string.
Write a program, which takes as input a string of decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9
and finds a number of at most the same number of digits, which when cubed, ends in
the given digit string.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input begins with a line containing only the count of problem instances, nProb, as a
decimal integer, 1 <= nProb <= 100. This is followed by nProb lines, each of which
contains a string of between 1 and 10 decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each problem instance, there should be one line of output consisting of the number,
which when cubed, ends in the given digit string. The number should be output as a
decimal integer with no leading spaces and no leading zeroes.
If there are many answers, the minimum should be chosen.</div>
