<h1>PHONY - Phony Primes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are chief debugger for Poorly Guarded Privacy, Inc. One of the top selling product, ReallySecureAgent©, seems to have a problem with its prime number generator. It produces from time to time bogus primes N.
After a while, you realize that the problem is due to the way primes are recognized.
Every phony prime N you discover can be characterized as follows. It is odd and has distinct prime factors, say ![$ N = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/d5459190f42f572764402cf8af580b26e4f189da.png) with ![$ p_ine p_j$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/4132b2d1ba16f2fcbe5d8985076f6e21d4bd3969.png), where the number k of factors is at least 3. Moreover, for all i=1..k, ![$ p_i-1$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/b5eeaddf9ea9718ee06fcbb83948d8c4bc8bc276.png) divides N-1. For instance, 561 = 3\*11\*17 is a phony prime.
Intrigued by this phenomenon, you decide to write a program that enumerates all such N's in a given interval ![$ [N_{min},N_{max}[$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/75c74f181f15e4a459bd92414205efba38bbbbd5.png) with ![$ 1 le N_{min} &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; N_{max} &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 2^31, N_{max}-N_{min} &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 10^6$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/3d53ab4fcb0f01cfbc2be78c482384afc76bb0f6.png).
**Please note, that the source code limit for this problem is 2000 Bytes to avoid precalculated tables.**</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Each test case contains one line. On this line are written two integers ![$ N_{min}$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/13ca0394b120c1897a49af38c570fb26da8d9a3e.png) and ![$ N_{max}$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/c870e6474597e9b67b38b403469f35cc8a8f58af.png) separated by a blank. The end of the input is signalled by a line containing two zeros. The number of test cases is approximately 2000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case, output the list of phony primes in increasing order, one per line. If there are no phony primes in the interval, then simply output none on a line.</div>
