<h1>GNTFNTN - Giant fountain</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The Dystopian government has installed a giant fountain in front of the parliament building. The fountain consists of N levels stacked one on top of the other and is situated on top of a large tank of infinite capacity. The levels of the fountain are numbered 1 to N from top to bottom. The top l $ _{1} $ levels are identical with capacity c $ _{1} $ , the next l $ _{2} $ levels identical with capacity c $ _{2} $ ,... the final l $ _{K} $ levels with capacity c $ _{K} $ . Here l $ _{1} $ + l $ _{2} $ + ... l $ _{K} $ = N.
When water is added to level i beyond its capacity, the excess water overflows to level i+1. Water overflowing from level N is collected in the tank. Water is added to the levels in the following fashion. First, w $ _{1} $ amount of water is added to each level i such that s $ _{1} $</div>
