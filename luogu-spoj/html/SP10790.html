<h1>GONE - G-One Numbers</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
善恶之争仍在继续，Ra-1和G-1分别站在各自的一边。
在拯救了所有的城市之后，G-1意识到，一些人口为“G-1数”的城市很容易成为RA-1的目标。
G-1数是指各位数字之和是素数的数。
例如12，sum=1+2=3，3是素数。
G-1想找出所有人口可以是G-1的城市.
你能帮他吗？
你将得到人口的范围，你必须告诉他在这个范围内有多少个是G-1。
# 输入输出格式
### 输入格式
第一行一个数字c，表示范围个数。
以下c行，每行两个数字f,t，表示区间的两端。
### 输出格式
c行，分别表示对应范围内的G-1数的个数。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The War of Evil vs Good continues and Ra-One and G-One continue to be on respective sides.
After saving all the cities with [Ra-One Numbers](https://www.spoj.com/problems/RAONE/) G-One realised that some cities whose population is a "G-One Number" can be easy target for Ra-One.
A G-One number is a number sum of whose digits is a prime number
For eg. 12 .. sum = 1+2 =3 ... 3 is a prime number.
G-One wants to find out all the populations which can be g-One numbers....
Can You help Him.?
You will be given the range of population and you have to tell him how many in this range are G-One Numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>first line has number 'c' indicating the number of ranges.
'c' lines follow and contain two numbers ..... 'f' and 't' inclusive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print a single line per case giving the number of populations which are G-One numbers.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
