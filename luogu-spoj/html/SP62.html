<h1>IMP - The Imp</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述： 给你4个数A B C D, 假定有一点(x,y) 那么从这一(x,y)点出发可以移动到
(x+a,y+b) (x-a,y-b) (x+c,y+d) (x-c,y-d)
四个位置， 经过多次跳跃之后可以跳到一点(x,y) 求|x|+|y|的最小值。
输入： 一行，四个数A,B,C,D 之间用空格隔开
输出： 一行，|x|+|y|的最小值 数据范围： -100000 <= a, b, c, d <= 100000 (不要管数据下面那个[and 9 test cases more])</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>An Imp jumps on an infinite chessboard. Moves possible for the Imp are described by two pairs of integers: (a,b) and (c,d) - from square (x,y) the Imp can move to one of the squares: (x+a,y+b), (x-a,y-b), (x+c,y+d), (x-c,y-d). We want to know for which square different from (0,0) to which the Imp can jump from (0,0) (possibly in many moves) the value |x|+|y| is the lowest.
### Task
Write a program which
- reads from standard input two pairs (a,b) and (c,d) of integers, different from (0,0), describing moves of the Imp,
- determines a pair of integers (x,y) different from (0,0), for which the Imp can jump (possibly in many moves) from square (0,0) to square (x,y) and for which the value |x|+|y| is the lowest.
- writes out to standard output the value |x|+|y|.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Ten test cases. Each test consists of four numbers a,b,c,d in one line, separated by spaces.
-100000 <= a, b, c, d <= 100000</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For every test case your program should write a single line with a number equal the lowest possible value |x|+|y|.</div>
