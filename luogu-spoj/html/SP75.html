<h1>EDIT1 - Editor【卡语言已隐藏】</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目：编辑器
输入一个字符串，当遇到这些字符时：
\n，换一行。如果这一行已经为空，则忽略所有后面的字符并输出前面操作的结果。
d，将现在这一行的字符复制后粘贴至这一行最后。比如当现在这一行是ab时，出现两个d，则此行变为abababab。
其他字符，放到这一行最后。
输入一个字符串，保证不会在该行为空时出现d。
输出操作过后的字符串。保证每一行长度不超过150。
感谢@nantf 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Have you ever programmed in Brainf\*\*k? If yes, then you know how annoying it is to press the same key several times in a row. So what we all need, is a good editor. Here are the functions that the editor should have:
- '\\n': begin a new line. If the last line was empty, stop processing and print out all lines.
- 'd': copy all characters from the current line, and append them after the last character in this line. For example, if current line contains ab, and d is pressed two times, the result will be abababab
- any other character: append it to the current line.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There is exactly one test case. You can assume, that there is no key press of 'd' when the line is still empty.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Print the output that the editor described above would produce on the given input. You can assume, that no line is created with more than 150 characters.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>sample-test\n-dd-d-dd\nend signalled by two newlines\n\n</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
