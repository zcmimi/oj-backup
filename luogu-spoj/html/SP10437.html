<h1>IOPC1202 - Quadrilaterals</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>多组数据。
每组数据将会给出一个正方形顶点的坐标，并保证都是整数。
现在请你考虑所有的凸四边形，使其各边中点为原正方形的顶点，并求出所有符合要求的四边形的面积总和。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given the coordinates of the vertices of a square in the 2-d plane. All vertex coordinates will be integers.
Now consider all convex quadrilaterals which also have integer coordinates for their vertices such that the midpoints of their edges are the vertices of the original square. Find the sum of areas of all such quadrilaterals.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input gives T, the number of test cases (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each testcase output the total area of quadrilaterals with the given property. Since the answer could be very large, give the answer modulo 100000007.</div>
