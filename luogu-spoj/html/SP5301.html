<h1>QUERYSTR - Query Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>
McFn interesed in string problem recently.He found a interesing function and he felt he could use this function to invent a new match algorithm.
For a string S \[1 ... n\] and i ¡Ê \[1, n\], define F (i) is the length of the longest common suffix of S and S \[1 ... i\].
For example, for the string S \[1 ... 11\] = zaaxbaacbaa, then F (1) = 0, F (2) = 1, F (3) = 2 (note that S \[1 ... 3\] = zaa), F (4) = 0, ... ... F (10) = 1, F (11) = 11;
For the string S \[1 ... n\], i ¡Ê \[1, n\], S \[i ... n\] is its suffix;</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is a integer T.the number of test cases
for each test case
The first line is a string S, composed of only lowercase letters, len (s) is the length of s, 1 <= len (s) <= 1000000;
Next line, a number N (1 <= N <= 100000), denote that the number of quiries;
The next N lines, each line contains a number x (1 <= x <= len (s)).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each x the output F (x);</div>
