<h1>CNTINDX - Count The Indexes</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let's deal with an array, the most important data structure of computer science. You will be given some operations to do. There will be three types of operations:
Type 1: Insert a number at the end of the array.
Type 2: Delete the last number of the array, where the last number means the latest number which has been inserted.
Type 3: You will get a number and two indices i & j where i<=j. Now you will have to answer how many time the number appears in the array starting from i to j.
You may assume that initially the array is empty.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Each file contains one test case. The first line is an integer Q(1<=Q<=200000), the number of operations. Each of the next Q lines contains an opeation. The operations will appear as the formats below:
1 x , where 1<=x<=200000, which means you have to insert number x at the end of the array.
0 , For this operation, you have to delete the last number of the array
2 x i j , Here, you have to find how many times x appers in the array from i to j. Here x will always be present in the array and 1<=i<=j<=length the array.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For deletion, if the array is already empty, then output a string "invalid" (without quote),otherwise you don't need to print anything for deleting numbers. For the operation type of 2, you have to output an integer, how many times x appears in the array from i to j inclusive.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
