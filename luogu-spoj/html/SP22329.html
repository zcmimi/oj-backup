<h1>CHICKEGG - Chicks</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are n hens in a farm. The egg hatching ability of all the hens decreases by 1 day after each time they hatch an egg. (i.e. every hen will hatch the next egg 1 day slower than the time it took to hatch the previous egg)
Let the initial egg hatching ability of Hen\[i\] be D\[i\].
- Hen\[i\] lays it's first egg on D\[i\]th day.
- Hen\[i\] lays it's second egg on 2\*D\[i\]+1 th day.
- Hen\[i\] lays it's thrid egg on 3\*D\[i\]+3rd day.
- Hen\[i\] lays it's fourth egg on 4\*D\[i\]+6th day.
- Hen\[i\] lays it's fifth egg on 5\*D\[i\]+10th day.
and so on..
Given **n** - the number of hens and the array **D** - the initial egg hatching ability of the hens, find the minimum number of days required to produce at least **K** eggs. You can safely assume that eggs neither gets damaged nor converted into hens.</div>
