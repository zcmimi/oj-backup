<h1>CODESPTI - Repairing Roads</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The country of Byteland contains of N cities and N - 1 bidirectional roads between them such that there a path between any two cities. The roads in Byteland were built long ago and now they are in need of repair. You have been hired to repair all the roads. You intend to do this by dispatching robots on some of the roads. Each robot will repair the road he is currently on and then move to one of the adjacent unrepaired roads. After repairing that, he will move to another adjacent unrepaired road, repair that and so on. Two roads are adjacent if they have the same city at one of their endpoints. For the process to be efficient, no two robots will can ever repair the same road, and no road can be visited twice. What is the least number of robots needed to accomplish the task?</div>
