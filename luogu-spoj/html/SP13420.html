<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> After solving [Fib-Factorization](http://www.spoj.com/problems/BMS1988/) and [ModFib-Period](http://www.spoj.com/problems/PISANO/), you would probably be interested by solving this new task: Simply compute Fib(N) mod Fib(K), where Fib(N) denotes the Nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. (If N</div>
