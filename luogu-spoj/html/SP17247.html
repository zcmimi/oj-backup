<h1>PR003004 - Digit Sum</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出两个整数$a$和$b$($0\le a \le b \le 10^{15}$)，求出区间$[a,b]$中每个数的数字和的和，有$t$组数据，第一行输入$t$，例如区间$[28,31]$的答案为$2+8+2+9+3+0+3+1=28$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For a pair of integers a and b, the digit sum of the interval \[a,b\] is defined as the sum of all digits occurring in all numbers between (and including) a and b. For example, the digit sum of \[28, 31\] can be calculated as:</div>
