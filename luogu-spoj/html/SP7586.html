<h1>NUMOFPAL - Number of Palindromes</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>求一个串中包含几个回文串
感谢@yler 提供翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Each palindrome can be always created from the other palindromes, if a single character is also a palindrome. For example, the string "malayalam" can be created by some ways:
\* malayalam = m + ala + y + ala + m
\* malayalam = m + a + l + aya + l + a + m
We want to take the value of function NumPal(s) which is the number of different palindromes that can be created using the string S by the above method. If the same palindrome occurs more than once then all of them should be counted separately.</div>
