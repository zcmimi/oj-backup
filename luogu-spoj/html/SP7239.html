<h1>IPCELLS - Cells</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Tim loves spreadsheets. Everything he does on a computer, he does in a spreadsheet. Track his expenses? Create a spreadsheet! Decide which car to buy? Create a spreadsheet to compare them! Make an inventory of his games? Create a spreadsheet! Decide which girl he loves most? …
Unfortunately his spreadsheet software just crashed and he needs some of the data right now and does not have the time to install a competing office suit.
Given the formulas used in the cells of a spreadsheet, calculate the values of all the cells.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains an integer T specifying the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank line.
Each test case starts a single number N giving the number of expression. Each of the following N lines contains a single cell formula of the form “CELL = EXPRESSION”, where CELL is the name of the cell and EXPRESSION is a mathematical expression consisting of cell names and the operators +, -, \* and /. A cell name is a non-empty sequence of letters followed by a positive integer.
Each test case is correct: there are no cycles, and all cells referenced in expressions have definitions.
Evaluating expressions
When evaluating an expression, usual priorities apply: first we evaluate all \* and / (left to right), and only then all + and - (again, left to right).
You may assume that the expressions are such that when evaluating the expression in correct order, the result and also all intermediate values will fit into 32-bit signed integer variables.
The operator / represents integer division which is always rounded down. The dividend will always be non-negative and the divisor will always be positive.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output the calculated values of cells, one per line, in the form “CELL = VALUE”. The rows in the output should be ordered alphabetically. (To compare two rows, take a look at the first character where they differ. The one with a smaller ASCII value goes first.)
Optionally, output a blank line between test cases.</div>
