<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Dr. Charles Xavier is trying to check the correlation between the DNA samples of Magneto and Wolverine. Both the DNAs are of length N, and can be described by using all integers between 1 to N exactly once. The correlation between two DNAs is defined as the Longest Common Subsequence of both the DNAs.
Help Dr. Xavier find the correlation between the two DNAs.</div>
