<h1>COPSEQ - Non Coprime Sequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given two integers, **n** and **m**.
Find and print the number of sequences of length n which satisfy:
- All elements of the sequence are positive divisors of m
- For any two adjacent elements, say p and q, there exists at least one prime which divides both of them.
Print the number of such sequences modulo 10 $ ^{9} $ +7</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
