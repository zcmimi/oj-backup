<h1>SCCCER - Soccer Ceremony</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
有四只来自巴西圣保罗的球队：科林斯、帕尔梅拉斯、桑托斯和圣保罗。为奖励在冠军赛上表现突出的球员，四支球队打算提前将他们选中，观看决赛。
今天，是决出四支球队中的冠军的重要日子。球员们赶到现场后，发现他们都只记得自己座位的行数，却不记得自己作为在哪一列。为了不违反足球史上最重要的规则之一，你要赶紧将他们安置好。
这条规则你应该知道，但为了题目的完整性，我还是要说明一下，就是同队不能有3个或3个以上的队员坐在一起。
### 输入格式
第一行，一个整数t，表示测试数据的组数。
对于每组测试数据，一个整数n和一个长度为n的字符串s，其中n代表球员个数，s[i]代表每个球员在哪支队伍，s[i]为C,P,N,S中的一个，分别代表科林斯、帕尔梅拉斯、桑托斯和圣保罗。
每组测试数据将用一个回车分开。
输出格式
输出为不违反规则而需要交换的最小次数。如果找不到解，输出-1。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are four popular football teams in the region of Sao Paulo : Corinthians, Palmeiras, Santos and Sao Paulo. Exactly n players among those football teams were pre-selected for an award regarding their performance on the championship.
Today is the big day when one of them will be awarded as the ultimate champion. The players have now arrived, and everyone remembered their seats row (which is the same for all the n players) but not their column number. And now, as one of the most basic and known rules about football ceremony's had been violated, you’re in a hurry to satisfy the rule by switching as few players as possible.
This rule, which I guess you should be familiar with but we are going to state it for the sake of completeness, states that there cannot be 3 or more players from the same team sitting in consecutive seats.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You’ll first be given an integer **T**, which represents the total number of test cases.
Each test case consist of a single integer **N** (1<= **N** <= 20) that represents the number of players invited to the ceremony. This is followed by a string **S** of length **N** representing the team at which each player belongs to. Each character **S\[i\]** of **S** will be one of the following **C**, **P**, **N**, **S**, meaning that the player seated at position **i** belongs to Corinthians, Palmeiras, Santos or Sao Paulo respectively.
Each test case will be separated by a new line.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output should consist of a single number per test case. That number should be the minimum number of players that need to change their seats to satisfy the rule, if there is no way to satisfy the rule output -1 instead.</div>
