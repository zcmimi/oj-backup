<h1>MTELE - Tele Broadcast</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MTELE/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MTELE/vn/) A TV-network plans to broadcast an important football match. Their network of transmitters and users can be represented as a tree. The root of the tree is a transmitter that emits the football match, the leaves of the tree are the potential users and other vertices in the tree are relays (transmitters). The price of transmission of a signal from one transmitter to another or to the user is given. A price of the entire broadcast is the sum of prices of all individual signal transmissions. Every user is ready to pay a certain amount of money to watch the match and the TV-network then decides whether or not to provide the user with the signal. Write a program that will find the maximal number of users able to watch the match so that the TV-network’s doesn’t lose money from broadcasting the match.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input file contains two integers N and M, 2 ≤ N ≤ 3000, 1 ≤ M ≤ N-1, the number of vertices in the tree and the number of potential users. The root of the tree is marked with the number 1, while other transmitters are numbered 2 to N-M and potential users are numbered N-M+1 to N. The following N-M lines contain data about the transmitters in the following form: K A1 C1 A2 C2 ... AK CK Means that a transmitter transmits the signal to K transmitters or users, every one of them described by the pair of numbers A and C, the transmitter or user’s number and the cost of transmitting the signal to them. The last line contains the data about users, containing M integers representing respectively the price every one of them is willing to pay to watch the match.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first and the only line of the output file should contain the maximal number of users described in the above text.</div>
