<h1>POWFIB - Fibo and non fibo</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The problem is simple.
Find **(a^b) % MOD**
where ,
a = Nth **non-fibonacci** number
b = (Nth **fibonacci** number)%MOD
MOD = 10^9+7
Consider fibonacci series as 1,1,2,3,....
**Note :** It is guaranteed that Nth non-fibonacci number will always be less than MOD value for every value of N used.</div>
