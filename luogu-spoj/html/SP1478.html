<h1>PT07B - The Easiest Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given an unweighted, undirected tree _T_. We say _T_ is special iff it has this property:
"All nodes of degree greater than or equal to 3 are surrounded by at most two nodes of degree two or greater."
Finding maximal size subtree of this tree so that it's a special tree.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ --- number of nodes in the tree (0 < _N_ <= 10 $ ^{6} $ ). Next _N_-1 lines contain _N_-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (_u_, _v_) means there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_ (1 <= _u_, _v_ <= _N_).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>At the first line, output number of nodes in the optimal subtree you found. Next lines, print all edges belong to that subtree, each line contains a pair _u_ _v_ means an edge between node _u_ and node _v_.</div>
