<h1>ADAUSORT - Ada and Unstable Sort</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug had a lecture about algorithms. She learned that sorting can be done in O(NlogN) time. She also learned concept of **stable sort**. For those who missed the lecture, it means that as long as there are two equal elements in the array their mutual position **won't** change after the sort.
Ada wanted to come up with something new, so she proposed **unstable sort**. It is sort with following property: "As long as there are two equal elements in the array their mutual position **will** change after the sort".
As Ada has only theoretical knowledge about it, she has asked you to construct such algorithm for her.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of each test-case will contain an integer **1 , the length of an array.**
The next line will contain **N** integers **1 , the elements of the array.**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test-case, print **N** numbers, the indexes of each element on which it was in original array. Indexes start with **1**.</div>
