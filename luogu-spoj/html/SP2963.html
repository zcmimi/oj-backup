<h1>PAINTBLC - Painting Blocks (Act II)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>_n_ blocks are put in a line. You have _k_(1<=_k_<=15) kinds of dope, the _i_-th dope is enough to paint c $ _{i} $ (1<=c $ _{i} $ <=6) blocks. You may assume the sum of all the c $ _{i} $ equals to _n_. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to paint the blocks with these kinds of dope, such that no two adjacent blocks are painted with the same kind of dope.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of multiple test cases, the number of them (<=2000) is given in the very first line. For each test case, the first line contains an integer _k_, the second line contains _k_ integers, c $ _{1} $ , c $ _{2} $ , ...c $ _{k} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line with an integer, the number of ways modulo 1000000007.</div>
