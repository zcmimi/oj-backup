<h1>AMATH - Another Mathematical Problem</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given two numbers n (1<=n<10 $ ^{100} $ ) and k (1<=k<=100), you are to determine whether there exists a positive integer T which satisfies that for every positive integer a, n $ ^{a+T} $ -n $ ^{a} $ is divisible by 10 $ ^{k} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated integers n and k. Input terminate by EOF.
The number of test cases will not more than 20.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, you should output the smallest positive integer number T which satisfies the condition above, or -1 if it doesn't exist.</div>
