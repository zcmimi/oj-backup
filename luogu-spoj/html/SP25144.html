<h1>ADST01 - Truncky Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Asutosh is very passionate about numbers. he has found a new type of numbers and calls them 'truncky numbers'.
He has challenged his friend Shantanu to find the sum of first n truncky numbers. As shantanu is weak at programming,
help him to complete his challenge.
A Truncky number is defined as:-
1\) sum of digits in the number is of the form (5\*k + 1) where k=number of digits.
2)absolute difference between any two digits in the number is either 0 or 1.
3)digits are in the non decreasing order.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>the first line contains T(number of test cases).Each test contains only one integer n.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>print in single line sum of first n truncky numbers modulo 10^9 + 7.
Each output in new line.
CONSTRAINTS:
T<=30
N<=10^17</div>
