<h1>PRIMEPOW - Prime Power Test</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [Finite fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) only exist when the order (size) is a prime power _p $ ^{k} $_ (where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer). For each prime power, there is a finite field with this size, and all fields of a given order are isomorphic. Finite fields are fundamental in a number of areas of mathematics and computer science, including number theory, algebraic geometry, Galois theory, finite geometry, cryptography and coding theory.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer _T_, the number of test cases. On the next _T_ lines, you will be given an integer _N_ : a proposed order to be tested.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output _T_ lines, one for each test case, with _p k_ if _N_ can be the order of a finite field. _p_ must be a prime number, and _k_ an integer such that _N_=_p $ ^{k} $_ . Else output "Invalid order".</div>
