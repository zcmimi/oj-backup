<h1>SAMER08K - Shrinking Polygons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A polygon is said to be _inscribed_ in a circle when all its vertices lie on that circle. In this problem you will be given a polygon inscribed in a circle, and you must determine the minimum number of vertices that should be removed to transform the given polygon into a _regular polygon_, i.e., a polygon that is equiangular (all angles are congruent) and equilateral (all edges have the same length).
When you remove a vertex _v_ from a polygon you first remove the vertex and the edges connecting it to its adjacent vertices _w_ $ _{1} $ and _w_ $ _{2} $ , and then create a new edge connecting _w_ $ _{1} $ and _w_ $ _{2} $ . Figure (a) below illustrates a polygon inscribed in a circle, with ten vertices, and figure (b) shows a pentagon (regular polygon with five edges) formed by removing five vertices from the polygon in (a).

<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains one integer _N_ indicating the number of vertices of the inscribed polygon (3 N N integers _X_ $ _{i} $ separated by single spaces (1 X $ _{i} $ i N -1). Each _X_ $ _{i} $ represents the length of the arc defined in the inscribing circle, clockwise, by vertex _i_ and vertex (_i_+1) mod _N_. Remember that an _arc_ is a segment of the circumference of a circle; do not mistake it for a _chord_, which is a line segment whose endpoints both lie on a circle.
The end of input is indicated by a line containing only one zero.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case in the input, your program must print a single line, containing the minimum number of vertices that must be removed from the given polygon to form a regular polygon. If it is not possible to form a regular polygon, the line must contain only the value -1.</div>
