<h1>KSEQ - 123 Sequence</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A 123 sequence is defined as a non-decreasing sequence of length>=2, where each number is 1 or 2 or 3. The difference between all unique pairs of numbers is given i.e. for a 123 sequence a $ _{1} $ , a $ _{2} $ , a $ _{3} $ , ..., an the differences are a $ _{j} $ -a $ _{i} $ for 1<=i<j<=n. Since the 123 seq contains only 1, 2, 3 the difference between any pair can be 0, 1, 2. Given the number of 0s, 1s, 2s in the difference sequence X, Y, Z respectively, your task is to find the number of distinct 123 sequences that could result in X, Y, Z. Two 123 sequences A and B are considered different if there exists atleast one i such that A $ _{i} $ is not equal to B $ _{i} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
