<h1>ADAGAME - Ada and Game</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug is playing **Game of Digits** against her friend Velvet Mite Vinit. The game is played in following manner: At first, there is a four-digit number and a number of moves. Both Ada and Vinit take turns alternately (beginning with Ada). Both of them must increase ANY digit of the number, but if the digit was 9 it will become 0.
For example number 3590 can be expanded to: 4590,3690,3500 or 3591. If after all turns the number is greater than the original number, Ada wins - otherwise Vinit is the winner. Both of them play optimaly - can you decide who is the winner?
PS: It is possible, that Ada will have one more turn (if number of turns is odd)</div>
