<h1>LCPC11B - Co-Prime</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>输入的第一行包含T（0<T<=100）测试组的数量，接下来的每一行包含三个整数A、B、N，其中（1<=A<=B<=1015）和（1<=N<=109）。 要求求出区间【A,B】中与N互质的数的个数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a number N, you are asked to count the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N.
Two integers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they have no common positive divisors other than 1 or, equivalently, if their greatest common divisor is 1. The number 1 is relatively prime to every integer.
Input Specification
The first line on input contains T (0 < T <= 100) the number of test cases, each of the next T lines contains three integers A, B, N where (1 <= A <= B <= 1015) and (1 <= N <= 109).
Output Specification
For each test case, print the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N. Follow the output format below.
Sample Input
2
1 10 2
3 15 5
Sample Output
Case #1: 5
Case #2: 10
In the first test case, the five integers in range \[1,10\] which are relatively prime to 2 are {1,3,5,7,9}.</div>
