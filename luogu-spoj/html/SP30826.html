<h1>BERNULLI - Bernoulli numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Your task is to compute natural logarithm of the absolute value of the [Bernoulli number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number) for many integer parameters **N**.
I/O format is the same as in [BINARYIO](../BINARYIO/).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Array of unsigned 32 bit integers in binary format (use [fread](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/) in C/C++)
To read _unsigned N_ use _fread(&N, sizeof(N), 1, stdin)_ instead of usual _scanf("%u", &N)_ until the end of file.
For each test case 2 N < 2 $ ^{32} $ , **N** is even. There will be up to 1,250,000 numbers in input file.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Array of [doubles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) in binary format (use [fwrite](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/) in C/C++)
To write _double a_ use _fwrite(&a, sizeof(a), 1, stdout)_ instead of usual _printf("%lf\\n", a)_.
For each **N** output ln(|B $ _{N} $ |) with absolute or relative error less than 10 $ ^{-15} $</div>
