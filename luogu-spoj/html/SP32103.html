<h1>TREEDEGREE - Degree of a Tree</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>mrm\_196 always represents the rooted trees in a simple array, but the array holds four conditions:
1. If the tree has N vertices, the array has length 2N.
2. Each vertex has a number (from 1 to N) which is written twice (but they may not be necessarily beside each other).
3. Between the numbers of each vertex, the numbers on its subtree are written.
4. Vertex 1 is always the root of the tree.
For example, he may store the following tree in one of these six ways:
![Sample Tree](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP32103/6dafdfddc43aa86023d7c1e20e5865a6ad99dcf9.png)
Tree = {1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 1}
Tree = {1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 5, 5, 3, 1}
Tree = {1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1}
Tree = {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1}
Tree = {1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1}
Tree = {1, 3, 5, 5, 2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1}
Your task is pretty simple, find what he always wanted, THE DEGREE OF THE TREE!!!!
Degree of a tree is the maximum degree of all its vertices.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer _T_ (1 T
The first line of each test contains an integer _N_ (1 N
The second line of each test contains 2_N_ integers _a_ $ _{1} $ , _a_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _a $ _{2N} $_ (1 a $ _{i} $ N) — the elements of his array.
It’s guaranteed that the given array always forms at least one valid tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test, print a single integer in one line — the degree of the tree.</div>
