<h1>MATSUM - Matrix Summation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目描述
有n组数据，每个数据中的矩阵大小为N(矩阵左上角坐标(0,0),右下角坐标(n-1,n-1))，矩阵所有元素初始值为0，有两种操作：
1."SET",将坐标为(x1,y1)的点上的值修改为s;
2."SUM",求出左上角坐标为(x1,y1),右下角坐标为(x2,y2)的子矩阵里元素的总和。
每组数据以end结尾。
对每个"SUM"操作输出结果，注意换行。
## 输入输出格式：
### 输入格式：
第一行包括一个整数n，表示数据组数。
接下来每组数据包括N(矩阵大小)，然后每行开始为"SET"或"SUM",输入以end结尾。
### 输出格式：
对每个"SUM"操作输出结果，注意换行。
$1\le N \le 1024$
$x_1\le x_2 \lt N\ ,\ y_1\le y_2\lt N$
保证答案是一个32位有符号整数。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A N × N matrix is filled with numbers. BuggyD is analyzing the matrix, and he wants the sum of certain submatrices every now and then, so he wants a system where he can get his results from a query. Also, the matrix is dynamic, and the value of any cell can be changed with a command in such a system.
Assume that initially, all the cells of the matrix are filled with 0. Design such a system for BuggyD. Read the input format for further details.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer **t**, the number of test cases. **t** test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer **N** (1 <= **N** <= 1024), denoting the size of the matrix.
A list of commands follows, which will be in one of the following three formats (quotes are for clarity):
1. "SET x y num" - Set the value at cell (x, y) to num (0 <= x, y < **N**).
2. "SUM x1 y1 x2 y2" - Find and print the sum of the values in the rectangle from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), inclusive. You may assume that x1 <= x2 and y1 <= y2, and that the result will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
3. "END" - Indicates the end of the test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line for the answer to each "SUM" command. Print a blank line after each test case.</div>
