<h1>PARTIT - Partition</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> A _partition_ of positive integer m into n components is any sequence a $ _{1} $ ,...,a $ _{n} $ of positive integers such that a $ _{1} $ +...+a $ _{n} $ =m and a $ _{1} $ <=a $ _{2} $ <=...<=a $ _{n} $ . Your task is to determine the partition, which occupies the k-th position in the lexicographic order of all partitions of m into n components.
The lexicographic order is defined as follows: sequence a $ _{1} $ ,...,a $ _{n} $ comes before b $ _{1} $ ,...,b $ _{n} $ iff there exists such an integer i,1<=i<=n, that a $ _{j} $ =b $ _{j} $ for all j, 1<= j< i, and a $ _{i} $ < b $ _{i} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case the input consists of three lines, containing the positive integers m, n and k respectively (1<=n<= 10, 1<= m<=220, k is not larger than the number of partitions of m into n components).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case output the ordered elements of the sought partition, separated by spaces.</div>
