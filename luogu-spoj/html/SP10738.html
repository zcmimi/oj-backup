<h1>RAONE - Ra-One Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the War between good and evil . Ra-One is on the evil side and G-One on the good side.
Ra-One is fond of destroying cities and its G-one's duty to protect them..
Ra-One loves to destroy cities whose Zip Code has special properties. He says he loves to destroy cities which have Ra-One numbers as their ZIp Code.
Any number is Ra-one if the Difference between Sum of digits at even location and Sum of digits at odd location is One (1).. For eg... for 234563 is Ra-One number
digits at odd location are 3,5,3 (unit place is location 1 )
digits at even location are 2,4,6
Diff = (2+4+6)-(3+5+3)=12-11 = 1.
And 123456 is not Ra-One number
diff = (5+3+1) - (2+4+6) = -4
G-One knows this about Ra-one and wants to deploy his Army members in those cities. 1 army member will be deployed in each city.
G-one knows the range of ZIP-Codes where Ra-One might attack & needs your help to find out how many army members he needs.
Can you help Him ?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>first line will have only one integer 't' number of Zip-Code ranges. it is followed by t lines

<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single number for each test case telling how many army members G-One needs to deploy.
