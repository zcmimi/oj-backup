<h1>OPTSUB - Optimal Connected Subset</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>- A point _P_(_x_,_y_) is called an integer point if and only if both _x_ and _y_ are integers.
- _W_ is the set which contains all the integer points on the plane.
- Two integer point _P_(_x_,_y_) and _Q_(_x'_,_y'_) are called adjacent if and only if _|x-x'|+|y-y'|=1_.
- _S_ is a set of integer points if and only if _S_ is a limited subset of _W_.
- If _S_ is a set of integer points, _R_ and _T_ belong to _S_,and there exist a limited integer point sequence _Q_ $ _{0} $ (=_R_),_Q_ $ _{1} $ ,_Q_ $ _{2} $ ,...,_Q_ $ _{k} $ ,_Q_ $ _{k+1} $ (=_T_) which satisfies that
- _Q_ $ _{i} $ !=_Q_ $ _{j} $ iff _i_!=_j_
- _Q_ $ _{i} $ and _Q_ $ _{i+1} $ are adjacent, for each 0<=_i_<=k.
- _Q_ $ _{i} $ belongs to _S_, for each 0<=_i_<=k+1.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The very first line of the input contains a single integer _T_, the number of test cases. _T_ blocks follow.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer _N_=|_V_|(_N_<=1000). _N_ lines follow, each contains 3 integers, the X-coordinate, the Y-coordinate and the weight(the absolute value of the weight<=100) of the _i_th integer point, separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>_T_ lines,each contains a single integer - the maximum sum of weights.</div>
