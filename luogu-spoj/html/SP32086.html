<h1>TPGA - The Permutation Game Again</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题意
有一类数组，满足以下条件：假设它的长度为$len$，则正整数$1 \dots len$在其中有且只有一个（全排列）。
给你一个正整数$n$以及一个长度为$n$的这类数组$arr$。在所有长度为$n$的这类数组中，求$arr$按字典序的排名。
### 输入
首先一个数$T$，表示数据组数，接下来有$T$组数据。
每组数据先是一个数$n$。接下来$n$个数，表示$arr_{1 \dots n}$。
### 输出
对于每一组数据，输出所求的排名模$1000000007$的值。
### 样例
```cpp
Input:
3
1
1
3
3 2 1
4
2 1 4 3
Output:
1
6
8
```
### 数据范围
$1<=T<=10,1<=n<=200000$</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Since YoMamaSoFat was able to answer Blackhood's and Kira's question as in http://www.spoj.com/problems/TPGAME/ (though with a little help from your side), it was my turn to ask him a question. This would again be a coding question as you might be knowing he is a noob in coding. I gave him a permutation of N distinct integers from 1...N and asked him the rank of the permutation when all possible permutations of the integers are arranged lexicographically. eg for N=3, all possible permutations arranged lexicographically would be:-
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
3 2 1
From the above, rank of 1 2 3 would be 1, rank of 1 3 2 would be 2 and so on...
**HELP HIM!**
**NOTE:- You may assume it is the same permutation which Blackhood gave him in http://www.spoj.com/problems/TPGAME/ to tell the no. of inversions for each integer in it.![Wink](../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif "Wink")**</div>
