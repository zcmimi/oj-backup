<h1>MY02 - Play with Strings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>```
All you have to do is implement the following algorithm ,which is a very popular compression technique.
1.You are given an input string A. (For eg. ababc )
2.Find all the rotations of A (In this case, it is ababc,babca,abcab,bcaba,cabab)
• Now sort them (After sorting, we have ababc,abcab,babca,bcaba,cabab)
• Then arrange them as follows:
ababc
abcab
babca
bcaba
cabab
• Now pick out the last column. It is ‘cbaab’. It is the result of this algorithm
• Also observe that the 1st row has the original string.(Use 1 indexing)
Now, for this problem, you are given the output and the row number that has the original string.
For the above example , it is ‘cbaab’ and 1.
Given these 2 parameters, you just need to decode it. (ie.,find the original string.)
Input:
Each test case has 2 lines.
1st line – An integer R that represents the row that contains the original string.
2nd line - A string that represents the output of the above algorithm. (Length of string <=2000) (All characters are lower case).
The input is terminated with R=-1.
Output:
The original string.
Sample Input:
1
cbaab
3
mnoag
-1
Sample Output:
ababc
mango
