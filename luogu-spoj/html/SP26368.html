<div>给出三个数a、b、m，计算a^b mod m的值
输入格式 第一行为整数n，表示有n组数据； 下面n~n+1行，每行输入a、b、m的值 输出格式 一共n行，每行输出a^b mod m的数
感谢@Steve_bm 提供的翻译</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as _b $ ^{n} $_ , involving two numbers, the base _b_ and the exponent _n_. When _n_ is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, _b $ ^{n} $_ is the product of multiplying _n_ bases:
_b $ ^{n} $_ = b x b x b x .......... x b
In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called _modulus_). Given two positive numbers, _a_ (the dividend) and _n_ (the divisor), _a_ modulo _n_ (abbreviated as _a_ mod _n_) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of _a_ by _n_. For instance, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3.
Now, you are given the value of a,b and m. print the value of **a $ ^{b} $ mod m**</div>
