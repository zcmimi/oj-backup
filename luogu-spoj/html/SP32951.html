<h1>ADASTRNG - Ada and Substring</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给你一个小写字符串
输出26个数，代表以'a'-'z'开头的本质不同的子串个数</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug was exchanging gifts with her friend. What a surprise - they gave her string. As they like her very much, they brought her a very long string. The goodness of the string is the number of distinct substrings.
As you might already know, each letter has different value so Ada wants to know the number of distinct substrings begining with each letter.</div>
