<h1>DYNACON1 - Dynamic Tree Connectivity</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述
给出一个森林，初始时有$N$个点，没有边。森林中的边是双向的。你需要支持以下操作：
**add A B**：连接$A\ B$两点，保证连接完成后仍是森林。
**rem A B**：断开连接在$A\ B$之间的边，保证边存在。
**conn A B**：询问$A\ B$之间是否存在路径。
输入格式
第一行两个正整数$N,M(1 \leq N , M \leq 10^5)$
接下来$M$行每行一个操作
输出格式
对于每一个**conn**操作输出一行，如果存在路径输出`YES`，否则输出`NO`</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A forest of unrooted trees initially consists of N (1
Your task is to maintain that forest and answer connectivity queries.
All edges in the problem are **undirected**.
You will receive the following queries, where (1
- **add** A B : add an edge between vertices A and B, where initially there is no path between A and B.
- **rem** A B : remove edge between vertices A and B, where initially there is an edge between A and B.
- **conn** A B : print **YES** if there is a path between A and B and **NO** otherwise, where A and B are different.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains the number of initial single-vertex trees N and the number of queries M (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each **conn** query output **YES** or **NO**. Pay attention to letter case.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
