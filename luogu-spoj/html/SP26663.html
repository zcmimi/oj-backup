<h1>TAXI2 - Theater shade in Berland </h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In Berland a new movie was released on the occassion of 14th Feb. The craze for this movie was very much among the peoples of the city. So many of them decided to go to the only Movie Theatre of Berland. As berland is very much developed there are many large(tall) buildings, including the movie theatre. At each building except theatre, there exist a person (who wants to see movie) or a taxi driver with his taxi. As it is very late in the night each taxi driver will only accomodate only one passenger and also he will only drive for **T\[i\]** HRS (return journey is not included). You will be given the distance between building **D\[i\]** and the speed of each taxi driver **S\[i\]**. As I am the owner of this theatre help me by telling, the maximum number of people I will see in the theatre for the movie. **N+P+1**th building is the my theatre. Also, if a taxi starts his journey by taking a passenger, it only stops at the theatre.</div>
