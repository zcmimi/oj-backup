<h1>NWERC10H - Stock Prices</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In this problem we deal with the calculation of stock prices. You need to know the following things about stock prices:
- The _ask price_ is the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell a share of a stock.
- The _bid price_ is the highest price at which someone is willing to buy a share of a stock.
- The _stock price_ is the price at which the last deal was established.
Whenever the bid price is greater than or equal to the ask price, a deal is established. A buy order offering the bid price is matched with a sell order demanding the ask price, and shares are exchanged at the rate of the ask price until either the sell order or the buy order (or both) is fulfilled (i.e., the buyer wants no more stocks, or the seller wants to sell no more stocks). You will be given a list of orders (either buy or sell) and you have to calculate, after each order, the current ask price, bid price and stock price.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test cases, at most 100. After that per test case:
- One line with an integer n (1
- n lines of the form "_order\_type x_ shares at y", where _order\_type_ is either "buy" or "sell", x (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Per test case:
- n lines, each of the form "ai bi si" , where ai, bi and si are the current ask, bid and stock prices, respectively, after the i-th order has been processed and all possible deals have taken place. Whenever a price is not defined, output "-" instead of the price.</div>
