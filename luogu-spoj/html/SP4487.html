<h1>GSS6 - Can you answer these queries VI</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题目大意
给出一个由$N$个整数组成的序列$A$，你需要应用$M$个操作：
* `I p x` 在$~p~$处插入插入一个元素$~x~$
* `D p` 删除$~p~$处的一个元素
* `R p x` 修改$~p~$处元素的值为$~x~$
* `Q l r` 查询一个区间$\left[l,r\right]$的最大子段和
## 输入格式
第一行一个数$N$，表示序列的长度
第二行$N$个数，表示初始序列$A$
第三行一个数$M$，表示操作的次数
接下来的$M$行，每行一个操作，格式见题目描述
## 输出格式
输出若干行，每行一个整数，表示查询区间的最大子段和

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a sequence A of N _(N <= 100000)_ integers, you have to apply Q _(Q <= 100000)_ operations:
Insert, delete, replace an element, find the maximum contiguous(non empty) sum in a given interval.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input contains an integer N.
The following line contains N integers, representing the starting
sequence A1..AN, _(|Ai| <= 10000)_.
The third line contains an integer Q. The next Q lines contains the operations in following form:
**I x y**: insert element y at position x _(between x - 1 and x)_.
**D x** : delete the element at position x.
**R x y**: replace element at position x with y.
**Q x y**: print max{Ai + Ai+1 + .. + Aj | x <= i <= j <= y}.
All given positions are valid, and given values are between -10000 and +10000.
The sequence will never be empty.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each **"Q"** operation, print an integer(one per line) as described above.</div>
