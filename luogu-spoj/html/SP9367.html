<h1>SFLIP - Segment Flip</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given N number a $ _{1} $ , a $ _{2} $ , ... , a $ _{N} $ . In a _segment flip_, you can pick a contiguous segment a $ _{i} $ , a $ _{i+1} $ , ... , a $ _{j} $ of these numbers, where i<=j and negate all the numbers in this segment.
You are permitted atmost K segment flip operations overall. Also, no 2 segments that you pick can overlap. That is, if you flip a $ _{i} $ , ... , a $ _{j} $ and a $ _{k} $ , ... , a $ _{l} $ then either j < k or l < i.
Your aim is to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the resulting sequence by applying appropriate segment flip operations meeting these constraints.
For instance, suppose the sequence is -5, 2, -3 and you are allowed a single segment flip. The best sum you can achieve is 6, by flipping all 3 numbers as a single segment to 5, -2, 3.</div>
