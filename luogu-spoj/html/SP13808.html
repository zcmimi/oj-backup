<h1>COLOR_CC - Colors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a Bipartite graph with N nodes, you have to colour each node in a way such that no two adjacent nodes have the same colour . Each node is allowed to choose colour from a subset of colours. print the possible number of ways.
You are given a symmetric matrix i.e. matrix\[i\]\[j\] is always equal to matrix\[j\]\[i\]
if matrix\[i\]\[j\]=='Y' then nodes i and j are connected by an edge matrix\[i\]\[j\]=='N' then nodes i and j are not connected</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>T -number of test cases ( N test cases follow )
N -number of nodes in graph . N lines corresponding to matrix
N line follows : each line contains xi -- total colours ith node can take , followed by i colours</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print the possible number of ways to colour the graph
T would be less than 20
0<= N <= 13
size of matrix will be N\*N
each element of matrix would be either 'Y' or 'N'
number of colours a node can take would be greater then equal to 0 and less than equal to 8 colour number would be less than 100000</div>
