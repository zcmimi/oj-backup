<h1>CURDPROD - CURD PRODUCERS</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A curd manufacturing factory owns curd producing machines of different qualities. A curd producer of quality q produces 1 unit of curd in q units of time.
For example, a curd producer of quality 5 produces 1 unit of curd at time 5, 1 unit of curd at time 10 and so on..
Given the qualities of all the machines, find the minimum time required to produce T units of curd.
**Input:**
The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each testcase, the first line consists of 2 integers n and T, the number of machines and the target amount of curd. The next n lines consists of integers representing the qualities of the producer machines.
**Output:**
For each test case, find the minimum time required to produce the target amount of curd.
****Input Constraints**:**
1 <= t <= 10^2
1 <= n <= 10^4
1 <= T <= 10^9
1 <= quality of each machine <= 10^9
**Note:** Note that a quality 5 producer produces only 1 curd at time 9 and not 1.8.</div>
