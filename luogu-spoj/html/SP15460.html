<h1>SELLINGA - Selling Art</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>To the best of her friends’ knowledge, Irina is a great artist. That is why she decided to expose her work and conquer the world. Well, just sell it alright. To help her, her friends executed a decent strategy. For a whole month they went to “The Manége”, an arts exhibition hall in Saint Petersburg. They wrote down on a piece of paper the times at which collectionists enter and leave. Then they consolidated the data and realized that the times at which collectionists enter and leave is the same for every day. For example, collectionist A enters at time eA and leaves at time lA every day from Sunday to Saturday.
To maximize exposure on any given day, she should arrive at the time the first collectionist enters and leave when the last to leave collectionist leaves, of course. This is impossible because she works every day and her boss won’t allow a day off. She can take several short breaks, fortunately.</div>
