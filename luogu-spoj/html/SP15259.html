<h1>LKS - Large Knapsack</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The **[knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)** or **rucksack problem** is a problem in <a>combinatorial optimization</a>: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size <a>knapsack</a> and must fill it with the most valuable items.
Just implement 0/1 Knapsack.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains two integers K and N, where K in the maximum knapsack size and N is the number of items. N lines follow where i $ ^{th} $ line describes i $ ^{th} $ item in the form v $ _{i} $ and w $ _{i} $ where v $ _{i} $ is the value and w $ _{i} $ is the weight of i $ ^{th} $ item.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output a single number - maximum value of knapsack. (All operations and the answer are guaranteed to fit in signed 32-bit integer.)
