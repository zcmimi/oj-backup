<h1>KPSUM - The Sum</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>## 题面：
给你一个正整数N,依次把1到N写下来，在每两个数字之间交替的加上+,-号(注意是数字不是数)，求这个表达式的值。例如，N=15时，表达式为1-2+3-4+5-6+7-8+9-1+0-1+1-1+2-1+3-1+4-1+5
## 输入数据
一个正整数N。
## 输出数据
表达式的值
## 范围说明
数据范围：30%的数据中，N<=100。
100%的数据中，N<=10^15</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One of your friends wrote numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., N on the sheet of paper. After that he placed signs + and - between every pair of adjacent digits alternately. Now he wants to find the value of the expression he has made. Help him.
For example, if N=12 then +1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8 +9 -1+0 -1+1 -1+2 = 5</div>
