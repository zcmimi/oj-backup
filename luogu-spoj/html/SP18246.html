<h1>IITWPC4C - Maggu and Vectors</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Maggu was teaching vectors using triangle diagrams to to his little brother. Now in the midst of lesson he went for a coffee and on returning finds all his triangles disassembled into constituent vectors by his naughty brother. He needs to recreate the triangles. He needs your help in doing this task quickly as he has to go for an internship interview.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line will contain T (1 <= T <= 10), the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of first line N, number of vectors. Next line will contain N (1 <= N <= 1000) vectors of the form of a b -1000<=a,b<=1000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>You have to print, in a new line for every test case, “YES” if any 3 vectors among N form a triangle, “NO” otherwise.</div>
