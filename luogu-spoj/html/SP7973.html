<h1>ACPC10E - Sometimes, a penalty is good!</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>### 题目描述
国际足联准备对世界杯的规则做一些改动。目前，32支球队争夺冠军的过程分为两个阶段。第一个阶段，也就是小组赛，32只队伍平均分为八个小组。每支队伍打三场比赛，分别对战同组的另外三只队伍，接着用一种积分制对一个小组内的4支队伍进行排名。第二阶段，也就是淘汰赛，每组排名前2的出现，进行16进8，8进4的比赛。接下来的半决赛将决出可以进入决赛的两支队伍，而胜者即为世界冠军。必须补充的是，在淘汰赛环节中，进行比赛的队伍应为2的次方。国际足联准备增加一些比赛队伍，这会导致淘汰赛的队伍数变动。此外，国际足联打算让一些特殊球队（前冠军、东道主等）直接进入淘汰赛（就是跳过小组赛阶段）。国际足联想知道新规则将会让比赛场数变成多少。请帮助他们。
### 输入格式
你的程序将会被一次性测试一个到多个点，每个点都由4个整数G,T,A,D组成。其中G是球队数（G>0），T是每组的人数，A（A>0）是每组出线队伍数，D是可以直接进入淘汰赛的球队数。
注意：如果A不是2的次方，你必须将他换成最接近的2的次方数。
最后一行是-1组成的虚拟行。
### 输出格式
对于每个测试数据，输出：
G*A/T+D=X+Y。
其中G、A、T、D同输入，X为比赛场数，Y为你必须加入而使得进入淘汰赛的队伍成为2的次方数的队伍数。
### 输入样例
8 4 2 0
8 4 2 1
-1 -1 -1 -1
### 输出样例
8*2/4+0=63+0
8*2/4+1=79+15</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>FIFA is considering a few changes to the way it organizes the Football World Cup. Currently, 32 teams compete for the World Title in two stages. During the first stage, known as the groups stage, the 32 teams are split evenly into 8 groups. Every team in the group plays 3 games, one against each team in their own group. Teams are then ranked within their group according to some points system. During the second (and final) stage, the top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stage where eight games are played to determine eight winners who would then play four games to determine four winners, then two games to determine the two winners who would then play the final game to determine the world champion. Needless to say, for the knockout stage to work, the number of teams in that stage has to be a power of two. FIFA is considering adding more groups, adding more teams to groups, and possibly changing the number of teams advancing from each group to the knockout stage. In addition, FIFA is considering having certain teams (previous champion, host country, etc.) advance to the knockout stage directly (without having to play in the groups stage.) But FIFA needs to know how many games will be played if any of these changes are applied. Please help them!</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your program will be tested on one or more test cases. Each test case is specified on a single line made of 4 natural numbers with the following format:
G T A D
Where (G > 0) is the number of groups; T is the number of teams in each group; A is the number of teams advancing from each group to the knockout stage; and D is the number of teams directly advancing to the knockout stage without going through the groups stage. Note that (0 < A If the total number of teams in the knockout stage is not a power of two, your program must increase them to the closest power of two.
The last test case is followed by a dummy line made of four -1’s.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, print:
G\*A/T+D=X+Y
where G, A, T, and D are as in the input, X is the total number of games, and Y is the number of teams your program determined it must add.</div>
