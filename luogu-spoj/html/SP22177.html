<h1>MARRIAGE - RajaRani</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The practice of polygamy is said to have origanted in the Salt Lake City where gender is not an important constraint. In order to obtain a clear count of marriages, each unmarried person living in the city is assigned a unique number. Some believe that love marraiges results in happiness while the rest believe in arranged marriages.
Whatsoever, its the parents who choose their heir's fiances/fiancees. Once their parents take a decision, their marriage is bound to happen in the near future. But recent studies on this city say that,
1\) A marriage between two persons having a difference of belief, results in a divorce.
2\) In order to avoid this from happening, some people often change their belief on the day of their marriage.
But it is sad to note that, both these scenarios results in a death of one of their well-wishers. Given the information about each unmarried person in the city and their fiances/fiancees, help them so that there is minimum number of deaths.
**Input:**
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
T test cases follow:
The first line of each test case contains two integers, N and M.
N : Number of unmarried persons.
M : Number of pairs for which their marriage has been fixed.
M lines follow:
Each of the M lines contains two integers : i & j
In the following N lines,the belief of each unmarried person is listed, either "Love" or "Arranged" . ( quotes for claification ).
**Output:**
For each test case, print a single line: "Number of Deaths"(quotes for qualification), followed by a colon(:) & a space, and then a single integer containg the minimum number of deaths. Refer the sample output for clarification.
**Constraints:**
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 140
1 <=M <=10000
1 <= i <= N
1 <= j <= N
**Example:**
**Input:**
1
3 2
1 2
2 3
Love
Arranged
Love
**Output:**
Number of Deaths: 1</div>
