<h1>SUPPER - Supernumbers in a permutation</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>给出一个序列，找出所有属于它的至少一个最长上升子序列的元素。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> An _n_-element permutation is an _n_-element sequence of distinct numbers from the set _{1, 2, ...,n}_. For example the sequence 2,1,4,5,3 is a 5-element permutation. We are interested in the longest increasing subsequences in a permutation. In this exemplary permutation they are of length 3 and there are exactly 2 such subsequences: 2,4,5 and 1,4,5. We will call a number belonging to any of the longest increasing subsequences a _supernumber_. In the permutation 2,1,4,5,3 the supernumbers are 1,2,4,5 and 3 is not a supernumber. Your task is to find all supernumbers for a given permutation.
Task
-----
Write a program which
- reads a permutation from standard input,
- finds all its supernumbers,
- writes all found numbers to standard output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each test case consists of two lines. In the first line there is a number _n_ (1<=n<=100000). In the second line: an _n_-element permutation - _n_ numbers separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every test case your program should write two lines. In the first line - the number of supernumbers in the input permutation. In the second line the supernumbers separated by single spaces in increasing order.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>5
2 1 4 5 3

<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
