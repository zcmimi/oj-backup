<h1>INCSEQ - Increasing Subsequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a sequence of N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000) integers S $ _{1} $ , ..., S $ _{N} $ (0 ≤ S $ _{i} $ < 100,000), compute the number of increasing subsequences of S with length K (1 ≤ K ≤ 50 and K ≤ N); that is, the number of K-tuples i $ _{1} $ , ..., i $ _{K} $ such that 1 ≤ i $ _{1} $ < ... < i $ _{K} $ ≤ N and S $ _{i1} $ < ... < S $ _{iK} $ .</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
