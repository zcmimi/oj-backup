<h1>ADACON - Ada and Connections</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ada the Ladybug was on a trip with her friends. They each bought a souvenir there. As all of them are mathematicians, everybody bought a number. They want to modify the numbers to have some connection between each other. They have decided to modify the numbers sou they would have their **GCD** greater than 1 ( **gcd(a $ _{1} $ ,a $ _{2} $ ,a $ _{3} $ ,...,a $ _{N} $ )>1**). Anyway it is not easy to change a number - the only thing they can do is to go to a proffesor in mathematics, which could forge a number **A** into number **A+1** or **A-1**. As this operation is not cheap, they want to minimize number of such operations. A number might be forged any number of times.
NOTE: **gcd(a,0)==a** (so gcd of two 0 is also 0)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
