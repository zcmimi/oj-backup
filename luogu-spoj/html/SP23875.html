<h1>DCEPC14A - Another Version of Inversion</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>神鱼 NaCly_Fish 有一个二维数组 $a$。如果存在两个数对 $(x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2)$ 满足 $x_1\le x_2,y_1\le y_2,a_{x_1,y_1}>a_{x_2,y_2}$，那么 $(x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)$ 称为一个二维逆序对。
reg3210TI 通过不明手段知道了 $a$，她想知道这个二维数组中二维逆序对的个数。
（对题意有所简化）</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>DCE Coders admins are way much geekier than they actually seem! Kartik has been following that tradition lately. How? Well, he took the inversion count problem to a whole new level!
Sounds pretty normal to you, huh? Wanna challenge him? Try solving his version of inversion count then!
You are given a 2-d array of integers. You need to find out the inversion count of that array. A pair of integers in the 2-d array counts as an inversion pair (A,B) if and only if:
- There exists a valid path from top-left corner (0,0) to bottom right corner (r,c) such that A and B integers lie on that path.
- A occurs before B on that path.
- And, A > B.
A valid path is defined as a path that can be traversed from top-left corner (0,0) to bottom-right corner (r,c) by moving only in right or downwards direction, without moving out of the grid.
Are you geekier than Kartik?
**Constraints:**
0 < R,C <= 300
0 < Ai <= 10^5, where Ai stands for an integer in the array.</div>
