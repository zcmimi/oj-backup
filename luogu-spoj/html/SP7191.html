<h1>HEXBOARD - Hexagonal Board</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Square boards (as the chessboard) are really common among games and luckily, they are easy
to draw with the help of a ruler. However, there exist other games that requiere hexagonal
boards, that are much harder to draw by hand.
The Institute for Client Permanent Comfort (ICPC) of a famous board game factory has decided
to provide their customers with an automated program to build hexagonal boards for several
games. The size of an hexagonal board is determined by a single integer N that indicates how
many cells there are in each of the 6 sides of the board. For example, a board of size N = 2
should look as follows when drawn by the program.
\_
\_/ \\\_
/ \\\_/ \\
\\\_/ \\\_/
/ \\\_/ \\
\\\_/ \\\_/
\\\_/
Your task is to help ICPC in making the program.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains
an integer N representing the size of the board (1 contains a single −1 and should not be processed as a test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output the hexagonal board of the required size, and a line with exactly
three asterisks. You have to follow the sample input and output, as well as the example given
above. Use only regular spaces, underscores (“ ”), slashes (“/”) and backslashes (“\\”). There
must be no trailing spaces at the end of printed lines, neither empty lines.</div>
