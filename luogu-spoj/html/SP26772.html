<h1>ANGRMTST - Lets Be An Anagrammatist</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Do you know what is an anagram? _**An anagram is a rearrangement of letters of one word to form another word.**_ For example: one of the anagram of the word “CODEMASK” can be “DEMOCSAK”. So, we can find different kinds of anagram of a word.
Now, you are given two array S & T. You have to find a **lexicographically smallest** contiguous subsequence of S which is an anagram of array T.
Between two sequence A & B, where length(A) == length(B), A will be lexicographically smaller than B if we can find an index i (1<= i <= length(A)) where A\[i\] < B\[i\] and for all j, A\[j\] = B\[j\] where 1 <= j < i.
**Input:**
The first line of the input is the number of the test cases Ts.
Each test case contains three lines. The first lines contains N & M, N is the length of array S & M is the length of array T.
Next line contains N integers of array S. Then another lines follows contains M integers describing array T.
**Constraints:**
1 <= Ts <= 20
1 <= N,M <= 200000
1 <= S\[i\], T\[i\] <= 200000
**Output:**
First you need to print the case number. Then on the same line, you have to print the index (1 based) of the lexicographically smallest contiguous subsequence of S which is an anagram of T. If there is more than one answer, you need to print the smallest index. If you can't find any anagram of the T in S, just print 0.
**Sample Input:**
`<pre style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">2<br></br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4 3<br></br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1 3 2 4<br></br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1 2 3<br></br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">5 3<br></br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3 2 1 4 10<br></br></span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">1 2 4</span></span></span></span>`**Sample Output:**

 ```
Case 1: 1
Case 2: 2
