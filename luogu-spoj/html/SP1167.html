<h1>MINCOUNT - Move To Invert</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目简述：
有一个高为h的硬币三角形，它的底部有h个硬币，倒数第2层有h-1个硬币，以此类推，最上层有1个硬币。问题是如何通过移动最少数量的硬币来翻转这个三角形。
![](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/SP1167/9e6385b0d52afa178ab5facf98b60a551e521074.png)
在h=4的情况下，至少需要移动3个硬币才能翻转这个三角形。
输入格式：
第一行为一个数N，表示有N个问题。下面有N行，为高度h，
0<=h<=10^10。
输出格式：
N行，第i行对应第i个问题的答案。保证所有答案在long long范围内。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A triangle made of coins of height h is as follows
It has h coins at the base and h-1 coins one level above base and so on.(Coins are placed as shown in the figure below)
And at the top most level there will be only one coin
Now given h the task is to invert this triangle by moving minimum number of coins. For example when h=4 triangle is
