<h1>PWSUM - Power Sums</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>![suma](../../../content/syntax_error:pwsum.png "pwsum")
Everyone knows that we can express sums of form sigma i = 1 to x ( i^k ) as polynomials</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of input contains a nonnegative integer k ( 0 <= k <= 300 ): the power we use in our sum.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first and only line of output should contain the canonic coefficient representation of the formula. To elaborate, this should be the form of your output:
a $ _{k+1} $ x $ ^{k+1} $ + a $ _{k} $ x $ ^{k} $ + a $ _{k-1} $ x $ ^{k-1} $ ... a $ _{0} $ x $ ^{0} $
ai here represents the coefficient that stands by the i-th power of x. As we only wish to find the formula modulo 10007, all the coefficients should be from interval \[0, 10006\] of integers. See the sample input and output for further clarification.</div>
