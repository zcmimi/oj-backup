<h1>MAFBOI08 - Mafia</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>拜特朗的警察接到匿名举报说，当地黑手党头目正在计划从港口到农村的一个秘密仓库进行大规模运输。警察知道运输的日期，他们知道运输将使用国家公路网。公路网由双向路段组成，每个路段都连接着两个不同的收费站（每个收费站可与其他多个车站连接）。车辆只能在收费站进出公路网。众所周知，黑手党运输时会从距离港口最近的收费站对应的高速公路出发，并将他们运输的物品留在距离仓库最近的收费站(在两者间进行运输时，不会离开公路并重新进入公路)。特警小队将控制选定的收费站，当黑手党们的车辆进入受监视的收费站时，他们便会被警方拘捕。从这个角度来看，最简单的选择是将警察小队安置在黑手党运输时的入口点和出口点（上面已经有过解释）。然而，控制每个收费站都会有一定的成本。警方希望尽量减低整体成本，所以要找出一些收费站使得花费最低，并符合如下两个条件：
- 所有由海港至仓库的车辆必须经过最少一个站。
- 而监视这些站的成本(即每一个收费站的花费之和)是最低的。
你可能会认为可以从港口通过高速公路到达仓库。

下面的￼$m$行描述了公路网。￼第$j$行包含两个整数￼$x,y$￼(![img](https://cdn.luogu.org/upload/vjudge_pic/SP9213/efd68bf8e4c867a3cf18716e017a40d52213dcb8.png))￼，这表明在编号为$x$￼和$y$￼的两个收费站之间有一个直接的高速公路段。每个高速公路段列出一次。
### 输出格式
输出只有一行，包含满足条件收费站的数量，和它们的编号，编号从小到大排序，以单个空格隔开。如果有多个答案，您的程序可以输出其中的任何一个。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The police in Byteland got an anonymous tip that the local mafia bosses are planning a big transport from the harbour to one of the secret warehouses in the countryside. The police knows the date of the transport and they know that the transport will use the national highway network.
The highway network consists of two-way highway segments, each segment directly connecting two distinct toll stations. A toll station may be connected with many other stations. A vehicle can enter or exit the highway network at toll stations only. The mafia transport is known to enter the highways at the toll station closest to the harbour and leave it at the toll station closest to the warehouse (it will not leave and re-enter the highways in between). Special police squads are to be located in selected toll stations. When the transport enters a toll station under surveillance, it will be caught by the police.
From this point of view, the easiest choice would be to place the police squad either at the entry point or the exit point of the transport. However, controlling each toll station has a certain cost, which may vary from station to station. The police wants to keep the overall cost as low as possible, so they need to identify a _minimal controlling set_ of toll stations, which satisfies the two conditions:
- all traffic from the harbour to the warehouse must pass through at least one station from that set,
- the cost of monitoring these stations (i.e. the sum of their individual monitoring costs) is minimal.
You may assume that it is possible to get from the harbour to the warehouse using the highways.</div>

-------
For the input data:
```
5 6
5 3
2
