<h1>GEOM - Geometry and a Square</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># **题目描述**
有谁不喜欢几何学吗？想象一下：在同一平面内，有一个正方形ABCD，顶点为顺时针方向。给出一个点P，它不与ABCD中任意一点重合。你想好了吗？感兴趣吗？好的，让我们继续！
过点A作BP的垂线a，过点B作CP的垂线b，过点C作DP的垂线c，过点D作AP的垂线d。a,b,c,d是否交于一点？这取决于正方形是什么和P点是什么。编写程序，发现这些线是否交于一点，如果是的话，找出这一点的坐标。
# **输入**
第一行，输入正方形对角线交点的整数坐标。
第二行，输入一个整数———正方形的边长。
第三行，输入点P的整数坐标。坐标值的绝对值不超过100。
# **输出**
对于每个测试样例，如果找到的点存在，则输出“YES”，否则输出“NO”。
如果输出“YES”，那么在第二行中，输出交点的坐标。坐标值保留小数点后一位。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Is there anyone who doesn't love geometry?! Just imagine: on the plane you are given a square ABCD, with vertices given in the clockwise direction. Also given is a point P which is different from all of A, B, C or D. Have you imagined it? Interested? Ok, let's continue!
Through vertex A a line _a_ is drawn that is perpendicular to line BP, through vertex B a line _b_ is drawn that is perpendicular to line CP, through vertex C a line _c_ is drawn that is perpendicular to line DP, through vertex D a line _d_ is drawn that is perpendicular to line AP. Do the lines _a_, _b_, _c_ and _d_ cross each other in one point? Ok, it depends on what the square is and what point P is given. Write the program that discovers if these lines cross in one point, and if so, finds the coordinates of this point.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>In the first line you are given the integer coordinates of the point in which diagonals of the square intersect. In the second line you are given one integer - the length of the side of the square. In the third line you are given the integer coordinates of point P. The integers do not exceed 100, in terms of absolute value.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case you must output YES if the sought point exsists, and NO otherwise. If you answer YES then in the second line you must output the coordinates of the intersection point. Coordinates must be rounded to one digit after the point.</div>
