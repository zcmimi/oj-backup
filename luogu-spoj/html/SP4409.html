<h1>AREA1 - Circle vs Triangle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a triangle and a circle in a plane. You can arbitrarily rotate or move them. What's the maximum possible area of their overlapping region?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input consists of one or more lines. For each line, there are four integers describing one test case: the lengths of three sides of a triangle _a_, _b_, _c_; and the radius of a circle _r_; where 1<= _a_ <= _b_ <= _c_ <= 100, 1<= _r_ <= 100, _a+b>c_ .
End of input is indicated by a line consisting four zeros.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single line showing the largest overlapping area of the circle and the triangle. We accept solutions with absolute error less than 10 $ ^{-2} $ .</div>
