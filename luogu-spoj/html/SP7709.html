<h1>JZPCIR - Jumping Zippy</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Jumping Zippy likes to jump. He jumps every day and feels boring. Then he think of a new way to jump. He jumps on a big round plaza. The plaza is divided into n sectors numbered clockwise from 0 to n-1. Firstly, he stands on sector 0. Each time, when he is stand on sector x, he can jump to sector (x-2)%n, (x-1)%n, (x+1)%n or (x+2)%n. His goal is to jump to each sector exactly once and jump back to sector 0 at last. And for the first jump, he never jumps to sector n-1 or sector n-2. He wants to find the number of different ways in which he can complete his goal.</div>
