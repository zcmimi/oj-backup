<h1>ADV04G1 - Regular expressions (Hard)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Regular expression is an expression which defines a set of strings. In this problem regular expression will contain only small latin letters a-z and special characters ‘?’, ‘\*’ и ‘+’. Each letter corresponds to itself in the defined strings. Special character can occur only after some letter and means the number of repetitions of the letter:
CharacterRepetitions ?none or one \*none or more +one or more</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains number T - the amount of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case is the given string S of length L. Next line contains number n - the amount of regular expressions. Next n lines describe one regular expression Ri each for which you should find the matching substrings.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each regular expression print the matching substring or -1 if there is no such substring in the given string.</div>
