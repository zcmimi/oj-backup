<h1>LATTICE - Distance on a square lattice</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let L to be an _nXn_ square lattice, you can consider its points as _(x,y)_, where _x_ and _y_ are integers from the \[1,_n_\] interval. And let f(_n_) to be the expected distance between two not neccesserily distinct points on the lattice. For example f(1)=0 and f(2)=(2 + √ 2 )/4.</div>
