<h1>MOOPIZZA - Moo University - Emergency Pizza Order</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Moo U的自助餐厅已经没有干草了，所以必须为参加Moo U会议的C（1<=C<=1000）小牛订购比萨。方便地，当地比萨店披萨农场的大比萨正好供应一头小牛。
披萨农场愿意为每头小牛制作披萨，但由于订单的大小，对订单有三个限制：
*披萨农场有长长的清单,总共T种（1<=T<=30）素食配料，每个披萨含有K（1<=K<=T）种配料。
*在比萨饼上没有2顶可以重复（比萨饼不能有洋葱和洋葱）。
*没有两个披萨可以具有相同的配料。
MOU U小牛非常挑剔。有些小牛可能不喜欢所有的配料。
小牛吃一个比萨饼，只有她喜欢披萨上的每一个配料。确定可喂养的犊牛的最大数量。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Moo U's cafeteria has run out of hay and so must order pizzas for the C (1 <= C <= 1,000) calves attending Moo U. Conveniently, a large pizza from the local pizzeria, Pizza Farm, serves exactly one calf.
Pizza Farm is willing to make a pizza for each calf, but, due to the size of the order, has three constraints on the order:
\* Although Pizza Farm has long list of T (1 <= T <= 30) vegetarian toppings, each of the pizzas must have exactly K (1 <= K <= T) toppings
\* No topping on a pizza can be duplicated (a pizza cannot have onions and onions, for example).
\* No two pizzas in the order can have the same set of toppings.
For example, if pizza 1 has onions, green peppers, pineapples, and wheat grass, then it can be the only pizza with that exact set of toppings, although pizza 2 might have onions, green peppers, pineapples, and also olives.
For ordering purposes, the toppings are numbered 1..T.
The calves at Moo U are very picky when it comes to their pizza toppings. Some calves might not like all of the toppings available. A calf will eat a pizza only she likes every single one of the toppings on that pizza. Determine the maximum number of calves that can be fed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> \* Line 1: Three integers: C, T, and K. \* Lines 2..C+1: Each line of space-separated integers describes which toppings one of the calves likes. The first integer on a line is the number of topping the calf likes. The remaining integers on the line are the toppings that the calf likes.</div>
