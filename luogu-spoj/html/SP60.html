<h1>DANCE - The Gordian Dance</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>戈尔迪安舞是一种传统的由两对舞者表演的比特兰舞蹈。一开始，舞者们站在广场的角落里，形成两对舞者：A-B和C-D。每对舞者都拿着一根伸出来的绳子。所以在起始位置，两条弦都是水平和平行的。
舞蹈由一系列动作组成。有两种动作：
（S）站在B点和C点的舞者交换位置（不松开琴弦），使站在B点的舞者举起他握着琴弦的手，并在到达C点时，让从C点到B点的舞者从他前面的手臂下通过。
（R）所有舞者顺时针旋转90度而不松开琴弦。这意味着a到b的舞者，b到c的舞者，c到d的舞者，d到a的舞者。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> The Gordian Dance is a traditional Bytelandian dance performed by two pairs of dancers. At the beginning the dancers are standing in the corners of the square _ABCD_, forming two pairs: _A-B_ and _C-D_. Every pair is holding an outstretched string. So in the starting position both strings are stretched horizontally and parallel.
![The starting position of dancers.](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP60/9186792c446cf7f1eb800cc1d312ad86e27b5ebe.png)The dance consists of a series of moves. There are two kinds of moves:
- (_S_) The dancers standing at points _B_ and _C_ swap positions (without releasing their strings) in such a way that the dancer standing at _B_ raises the hand in which he is holding the string and, when going to point _C_, lets the dancer going from _C_ to _B_ pass in front of him, under his arm.
- (_R_) All dancers make a turn by 90 degrees clockwise without releasing their strings. This means that the dancer from _A_ goes to _B_, the dancer from _B_ goes to _C_, the dancer from _C_ goes to _D_, and the dancer from _D_ goes to _A_.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). The first line of each test case consists of one integer _n_ equal to the nmber of moves already made, _0<=n<=1000000_. The second line of each test case consists of one word of length _n_, made up of letters _S_ and/or _R_.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For every testcase your program should write to standard output only one line with one integer number: the minimal number of moves required to untangle the strings and stretch them horizontally and parallel.</div>
