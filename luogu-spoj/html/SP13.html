题目描述
每一名顾客有时都会需要关于新的、不常见的产品的帮助。因此，热线服务对于每个公司都很重要。我们需要一个电话号码来让顾客总能听到准备好在任何事情上帮助他们的友好的声音。然而，我们需要很多人来充当热线服务的接线员，人力资源又总是那么昂贵。更重要的是，如果你要在凌晨四点向一个醉汉解释你真的不能给他威斯敏斯特宫的电话号码，你真的很难提供“友好的声音”。我们还发现一些问题非常频繁地出现，并且一而再、再而三地回答这些问题是一件令人厌烦的事。
ACM是一家希望解决它的热线问题的现代化的公司。他们想通过创造一个能够回答最常见问题的复杂软件系统来减少人类接线员的数量。客户的声音通过一个特殊的声音识别模式(VRM)来编码并转换成纯文本。这段文字接着被一个人工自动自适应应答算法(AAAAA)接受。常见问题从中被识别出来并自动回答。这之后答语被文本-语音转换模式(TTS)转成声音。
你的任务是编写这个AAAAA。因为你的算法应该是自适应的，所以它没有明确的知识基础。但它必须能够听懂英语句子并记住被提到的事实。每当问题问到这样的一个事实时，这套系统必须正确回答。VRM和TTS已经有人帮你实现了，所以AAAAA会以文本形式输入和输出。
输入输出格式
输入格式
在输入数据的第一行有一个单独的正整数T。它代表接下来的对话的数量。每个对话由0或更多行组成，每一行包含一个句子：陈述句或疑问句。陈述句以句号(.)结尾，疑问句以问号(?)结尾。同一个陈述句不会多次出现，然而疑问句可能会重复。每个对话最后会有额外的一行，这一行以感叹号(!)结尾。
句子可以包括单词、空格和标点符号(如引号、冒号、分号等)。所有单词都只包括英文字母表中的字母，大小写敏感。这意味着同一个单词总是以同样的方式书写，通常是小写。首字母缩略词、人名和一些其他单词可以大写字母开头。为简单起见，所有句子都以小写字母开头。只有在这个句子第一个单词的首字母需要大写时这个句子才会以大写字母开头。
关于陈述句
每一个陈述句以下列两种形式之一呈现(_代表一个空格):
主语_谓语[s][_宾语].
主语_don’t|doesn’t_谓语[_宾语].
方括号标记一个可选择的部分，而竖线表示两种变体。
主语是一个名词或代词的单数形式。谓语是一个指代动作的动词。宾语能够是任何的文本。宾语不包含句号。每一对”动词+宾语”确定唯一的行为。相同的动词后接不同的宾语会形成不同且相互独立的行为。换言之，也就决定了不同且相互独立的句意。没有宾语的句子可以认为是拥有一个空的宾语。同一个动词，当它不带宾语时，它的意思和带有任何宾语时都不同。
陈述句的第一个变种代表肯定句。”predicate[s]”表示一个适应主语的动词。如果主语是”I”或”you”，动词应该用复数形式。当主语是其他单词时，尾字母”s”是否加”e”由动词的结尾字母决定。我们认为没有不规则动词。
陈述句的第二个变种代表否定句。助动词”don’t”或者”doesn’t”也必须适应主语。如果主语是”I”或”you”则用”don’t”，其他情况下都用”doesn’t”。
一个特殊的集合名词”everybody”(作主语)可以使用。它意味着行为由任何主语发出。另一个特殊名词是”nobody”。这样的陈述句的主语也是任意主语，但它具有反面的意义。这两个集合名词都只能在第一种陈述句(没有”doesn’t”)中使用。陈述句”nobody likes something”和”everybody doesn’t like something”是一样的，唯一的区别是后者永远不会在输入数据中出现。
关于疑问句
每一个疑问句是以下三种形式之一：
do|does_主语_谓语[_宾语]?
who_谓语[s][_宾语]?
what_do|does_主语_do?
“do|does”总是与主语相适应(“do I…?”，”do you?”，”does 其他主语?”)。在第二种疑问句中，谓语总是与”who”适应，换言之，总是需要加上”s”。前文所述集合名词不能在疑问句中使用。
输出格式：
对每个对话，你的程序必须输出一行
Dialogue #D:
其中D代表这次对话的序列编号（从1开始编号）。对于每个疑问句输出三行：第一行重复该句，第二行包含回答，第三行为空行。不要对于陈述句输出任何内容。在每一个对话之后，输出与输入中一样的带有感叹号的最后一行之后输出一个空行。空行只包括一个换行符。
回答必须适当格式化来让TTS接受。只有在疑问句之前出现过的陈述句会被用来匹配回答。如果陈述句中有任何矛盾，回答永远是”I am abroad.”。如果句子谈论特殊主语”you”，它在回答中必须被”I”替代。如果句子谈论特殊主语”I”，它在回答中必须被”you”替代。动词必须永远与句子主语适应。正确回答的准确形式与疑问句的类型有关。
1.
do|does_主语_谓语[_宾语]?
如果有任何一个关于所提到的主语（或者everybody）、谓语和宾语的肯定句，那么回答是：
yes,_主语_谓语[s][_宾语].
如果有任何一个关于所提到的主语（或者everybody）、谓语和宾语的否定句，那么回答是：
no,_主语_don’t|doesn’t_谓语[_宾语].
除此之外的情况，回答都是：
maybe.
回答中的主语永远与问题中的主语相同。
2.
who_谓语[s][_宾语]?
如果有关于所提到的谓语和宾语的肯定句，回答是：
主语_谓语[s][_宾语]
如果两个或更多的主语和这个行为匹配，把回答中的主语替换成所有这些主语的并列，顺序与对应的匹配陈述句在输入中的出现顺序相同。名词之间用逗号和空格分开，最后两个之间用单词”and”分开。如果”everybody”在并列的名词中，那么就不要枚举这些主语，只输出”everybody”。如果并列中包含至少2个名词，那么谓语使用复数形式（没有后缀”s”），否则与这仅有的主语适应。例：
主语1,_主语2,_and_主语3_谓语[_宾语].
如果有关于”nobody”、 所提到的谓语和宾语的否定句，回答是：
nobody_谓语s[_宾语].
除此之外的情况，回答
I don’t know.
3.
what_do|does_主语_do?
如果有至少一个关于提到的主语(或”nobody”或”everybody”)的陈述句(肯定、否定均可)，来自这些句子中的所有谓语-宾语必须以对应句子在输入中出现的顺序包括在回答中。没有任何一个谓语-宾语组合会在回答中出现两次(可能的第二次出现必须忽略)。谓语-宾语组合之间用逗号和紧接着的一个空格分开，而最后两个谓语-宾语组合之间用一个逗号和一个单词”and”分开。请注意，在这里需要输出逗号，虽然在前一种回答中主语之间没有逗号(见上)。否定的回答具有与陈述句相同的形式，也就是说，助动词”don’t”或”doesn’t”会被使用，像下面这样：
主语[_don’t|doesn’t]_谓语1[s][_宾语1],[_don’t|doesn’t]_谓语2[s][_宾语2],_and[_don’t|doesn’t]_谓语3[s][_宾语3].
主语[_don’t|doesn’t]_谓语1[s][_宾语1],_and[don’t|doesn’t]_谓语2[s][_宾语2].
主语[_don’t|doesn’t]_谓语[s][_宾语].
除此之外的情况，回答
I don’t know.

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> Every customer sometimes needs help with new and unusual products. Therefore, hotline service is very important for every company. We need a single phone number where the customer can always find a friendly voice ready to help with anything. On the other hand, many people are needed to serve as hotline operators, and human resources are always very expensive. Moreover, it is not easy to pretend "friendly voice" at 4am and explain to a drunken man that you are really unable to give him the number to House of Parliament. It was also found that some of the questions repeat very often and it is very annoying to answer them again and again.
ACM is a modern company, wanting to solve its hotline problem. They want to decrease the number of human operators by creating a complex software system that would be able to answer most common questions. The customer's voice is analysed by a special Voice Recognition Module (VRM) and converted to a plain text. The text is then taken by an Artificial Automatic Adaptive Answering Algorithm (AAAAA). The most common questions are recognised and answered automatically. The replies are then converted to a sound by Text-to-Speech Module (TTS).
You are to write the AAAAA module. Because your algorithm should be adaptive, it has no explicit knowledge base. But it must be able to listen to sentences in English and remember the mentioned facts. Whenever the question is asked about such a fact, the system has to answer it properly. The VRM and TTS modules are already implemented, so the input and output of AAAAA will be in the text form.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input. It stands for the number of dialogues to follow. Each dialogue consists of zero or more lines, each of them containing one sentence: either statement or question. The statement ends with a dot character (.), the question ends with a question mark (?). No statement will appear more than once, however the questions can be repeated. There is one extra line after each dialogue. That line ends with an exclamation mark (!).
Sentences can contain words, spaces and punctuation characters (such as commas, colons, semicolons etc.). All words contain only letters of English alphabet and are case-sensitive. That means the same word is always written the same way, usually in lowercase. Acronyms, names and some other words can begin with capital letters. For simplicity, all sentences begin with a lowercase letter. Only if the first word should be written with a capital, the sentence begins with a capital letter. There are no unneeded spaces between words. No line will have more than 100 characters. There will be at most 100 statements per each test case.
###### Statements
Each statement has one of the following two forms ( \_ denotes a space):
_subject_ \__predicate_\[s\] \[ \__object_\] .
_subject_ \_don't|doesn't \__predicate_ \[ \__object_\] .
The square brackets mark an optional part, the vertical line two possible variants. Subject is a single word, noun or pronoun in singular. Predicate is a verb (single word) denoting some activity. Object can be any text. Object does not contain any dots. Any pair "verb + object" determines unique activity. The same verb with different objects makes different independent activities, i.e. the different and independent meaning of the sentence. Sentence without any object can be considered as sentence with an empty object. The verb without an object has different and independent meaning than the same verb with any non-empty object.
The first variant of sentence denotes a positive statement. The word "_predicate_\[s\]" means verb that matches the subject of the sentence. If the subject is "I" or "you", the verb has the same form as the infinitive. With any other subject, the letter "s" is appended on the end of the verb. Assume there are no irregular verbs.
The second variant is a negative statement. Verb "don't" or "doesn't" must also match the subject. The form "don't" is used with either "I" or "you", "doesn't" is used in any other case.
A special generic subject "everybody" can be used. It means the activity holds for any subject. Other special subject is "nobody". Such sentence also holds for any subject, but its meaning is negative. Both of these generic subjects can be used with the first variant only (without "doesn't"). The sentence "nobody likes something" is exactly equal to "everybody doesn't like something", except the latter form will never occur in the input.
###### Questions
Each question has one of the following three forms:
1. do|does \__subject_ \__predicate_ \[ \_object\] ? 2. who \__predicate_s \[ \__object_\] ? 3. what \_do|does \__subject_ do ?
The word "do|does" always matches the subject ("do I?", "do you?", "does any other subject?"). In the second type of question, predicate always matches the word "who", i.e. the "s" is always appended. Generic subjects cannot be used in questions.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each dialogue, your program must output the line Dialogue #D:, where D is the sequence number of dialogue, starting with 1. Then print exactly three lines for every question: the first line repeats the question, the second line contains the answer, and the third line is empty. Print nothing for statements. After each dialogue, print the same line with an exclamation mark that was in the input. Then print one extra empty line. Empty line contains a new-line character only.
The answer must be properly formated to be accepted by a TTS module. Only the statements appearing in the input before the answer are used for the corresponding reply. If there is any contradiction among statements, the reply is always I am abroad.. If the question and statements consider the special subject "you", it must be replaced with "I" in the answer. If the question considers special subject "I", it must be replaced with "you" in the answer. The verb must always match the subject of the sentence. The exact form of the correct answer depends on the type of question.
###### 1. does subject predicate \[object\] ?
If there is any positive statement about the mentioned subject (or generic subject "everybody"), predicate and object, the answer is:
yes, \__subject_ \__predicate_\[s\] \[ \__object_\] .
If there is any negative statement about the mentioned subject (or generic subject "nobody"), predicate and object, the answer is:
no, \__subject_ \_don't|doesn't \__predicate_ \[ \__object_\] .
Otherwise, the answer is: maybe.
Subject in the answer is always the same subject as the subject of the question.
###### 2. who predicates \[object\] ?
If there is a positive statement considering any subject, the specified predicate and object, the answer is:
_subject_ \__predicate_\[s\] \[ \__object_\] .
If two or more subjects match the activity, replace the subject in the answer with enumeration of all such subjects, in the same order as the corresponding statements have appeared in the input. Subjects are separated with comma and space, last two subjects are separated with the word "and". If "everybody" belongs to the group of enumerated subjects, do not enumerate subjects, and print "everybody" only. If the enumeration contains at least two subjects, the predicate matches the plural subject (i.e. verb is without trailing "s"), otherwise it matches the only subject.
_subject1_ , \__subject2_ \_and \__subject3_ _predicate_ \[ \__object_\] .
If there is a negative statement considering the generic subject "nobody", the specified predicate and object, the answer is:
_nobody_ \__predicate_s \[ \__object_\] .
Otherwise, the answer is: I don't know.
###### 3. what does subject do ?
If there are one or more sentences (both positive and negative) considering the specified subject (or a generic subject "everybody" or "nobody"), all verbs and objects from such sentences must be included in a reply in the same order as the corresponding sentences have appeared in the input. No verb-object pair can be included more than once (the eventual second appearance must be skipped). The verb-object pairs are separated by a comma followed by a space, the last verb is separated by a comma and the word "and". Please note the comma is printed here although there was no comma when separating the subjects in the previous type of answer (see above). The negative answers have the same form as the statements, that means the verb "don't" or "doesn't" is used:
_subject_ \[ \_don't|doesn't\] \__predicate1_\[s\] \[ \__object1_\] ,
\[ \_don't|doesn't\] \__predicate2_\[s\] \[ \__object2_\] ,
\_and \[ \_don't|doesn't\] \__predicate3_\[s\] \[ \__object3_\] .
_subject_ \[ \_don't|doesn't\] \__predicate1_\[s\] \[ \__object1_\] ,
\_and \[ \_don't|doesn't\] \__predicate2_\[s\] \[ \__object2_\] .
_subject_ \[ \_don't|doesn't\] \__predicate_\[s\] \[ \__object_\] .
Otherwise, the answer is: I don't know.</div>
