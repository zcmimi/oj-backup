<h1>M00PAIR - 0 0 Pairs</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>由一位数组成的序列，数字1最初写入计算机。在每个连续的时间步长，计算机同时将每个数字0转换为序列10并且将每个数字1转换为序列0 1。
因此，在第一步之后，获得序列0 1; 在第二个之后，序列1 0 0 1，在第三个之后，序列0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1，依此类推。
n步后，序列中会出现多少对成对的零？</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/M00PAIR/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/M00PAIR/vn/)A sequence consisting of one digit, the number 1 is initially written into a computer. At each successive time step, the computer simultaneously tranforms each digit 0 into the sequence 1 0 and each digit 1 into the sequence 0 1.
So, after the first time step, the sequence 0 1 is obtained; after the second, the sequence 1 0 0 1, after the third, the sequence 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 and so on.
How many pairs of consequitive zeroes will appear in the sequence after n steps?
### Input
Clarification for this Problem: The Range of inputs is from 1 to 999 in some order and in particular not in ascending order
### Output
For each input n print the number of consequitive zeroes pairs that will appear in the sequence after n steps.
### Sample
```
Sample Input
1
2
3
4
5
Sample output
0
1
1
3
5
```
**Notice : Long output - 1.45MB** - there are a lot of input/output so it is easy to TLE if you dont optimize in/out if you use Java ...</div>
