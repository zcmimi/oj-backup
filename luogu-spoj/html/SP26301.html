<h1>TOUGH - Bits. Exponents and Gcd</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Rastas's has been given a number n. Being weak at mathematics, she has to consider all the numbers from 1 to 2_n_ - 1 so as to become perfect in calculations. (You can assume each number is consider as a soldier).
We define the strength of number _i_ as the number of set bits (bits equal to 1) in binary representation of number _i_.
If the greatest common divisor of numbers _a_ and _b_ is _gcd_(_a_, _b_),
Rastas would like to calculate the function _S_ which is equal to: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP26301/f21024d8791400efdad030776219ae647a98255c.png)
As the friend of Rastas, it's your duty to calculate _S_ modulo 109 + 7.</div>
