<h1>NY10E - Non-Decreasing Digits</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A number is said to be made up of non-decreasing digits if all the digits to the left of any digit is less than or equal to that digit.For example, the four-digit number **1234** is composed of digits that are non-decreasing. Some other four-digit numbers that are composed of non-decreasing digits are **0011**, **1111**, **1112**, **1122**, **2223**. As it turns out, there are exactly 715 four-digit numbers composed of non-decreasing digits.
Notice that leading zeroes are required: 0000, 0001, 0002 are all valid four-digit numbers with non-decreasing digits.
For this problem, you will write a program that determines how many such numbers there are with a specified number of digits.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each data set there is one line of output. It contains the data set number followed by a single space, followed by the number of N digit values that are composed entirely of non-decreasing digits.
**Example**
```
Input:
3
1 2
2 3
3 4
Output:
1 55
2 220
3 715
```</div>
