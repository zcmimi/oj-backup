<h1>POLY1 - Polygon</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We say that two triangles intersect if their interiors have at least one common point. A polygon is called convex if every segment connecting any two of its points is contained in this polygon. A triangle whose vertices are also vertices of a convex polygon is called an elementary triangle of this polygon. A triangulation of a convex polygon is a set of elementary triangles of this polygon, such that no two triangles from the set intersect and a union of all triangles covers the polygon. We are given a polygon and its triangulation. What is the maximal number of triangles in this triangulation that can be intersected by an elementary triangle of this polygon?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The number of test cases _t_ is in the first line of input, then _t_ test cases follow separated by an empty line
In the first line of a test case there is a number _n_, 3 <= _n_ <= 1000, which equals the number of vertices of the polygon. The vertices of the polygon are numbered from 0 to _n_-1 clockwise. The following _n_-2 lines describe the triangles in the triangulation. There are three integers separated by single spaces in the (_i_+1)-st line, where 1 <= _i_ <= _n_-2. These are the numbers of the vertices of the _i_-th triangle in the triangulation.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case your program should produce one line with exactly one integer - the maximal number of triangles in the triangulation, that can be intersected by a single elementary triangle of the input polygon.</div>
