<h1>MAXISET - Maximal Independent Set</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MAXISET/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MAXISET/vn/)You are given an unweighted undirected graph G. Each vertex has a positive weighted associated with it. Weight of a set of vertices is defined as the sum of weights of all vertices in the set.
A set of vertices is called independent if there is no edge in the graph with both endpoints on vertices of this set.
A subgraph induced by a set of vertices is a graph with vertex set as the given set of vertices and edges in the original graph with both endpoints in the given set.
If s denotes a set of vertices, then Query(s, G) = Maximal weighted independent set in the subgraph induced by s.
Given q queries and the description of the graph, you are to output the weight of the Maximal weighted independent set corresponding to each of the queries.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case description starts with one line containing 2 integers n and m, denoting the number of vertices and number of edges.
Next line contains n space separated integers denoting the weight of vertices from 0 to n - 1 ( inclusive ).
Next m lines contains two integers u and v ( u != v, 0 ≤ u,v < n ), denoting an undirected edge from u to v.
Next line contains q, the number of querries.
Next q lines contain description of a query. Description of a query starts with an integer denoting the size of set s, followed by the vertices which are members of vertex set s.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output q lines containing the answer to each query. Print a blank line BETWEEN the output of multiple test cases.</div>
