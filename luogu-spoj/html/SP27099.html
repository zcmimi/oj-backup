<h1>FN16ROAD - Road Times</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Ubol Narongdid is the founder of a brash new startup company called Special D-Liver-E. She wants to corner the market on overnight deliveries of organs between hospitals in the Phuket area. For scheduling purposes it is important to have accurate estimates for the times to perform such deliveries. Several trips between various hospitals have already been performed, so delivery times between those pairs of hospitals are known. The company currently has software to estimate times for other (as yet untraveled) trips, but so far all the estimates have been woefully inaccurate.
You have been asked to come up with a method to improve these estimates. You have at your disposal the following information: 1) the length (in kilometers) of the roads connecting each pair of cities in the Phuket area, and 2) a set of times (in minutes) for various previously executed deliveries.
You know that roads are one-way, and each road has a fixed speed limit that lies between $ 30 $ and $ 60 $ kilometers per hour. Speed limits are real-valued and need not be integers. You also know that delivery trucks always take the route that minimizes distance traveled, and on each road will always travel at a constant speed equal to that road’s speed limit. Thus you know, for example, that if a given trip is $ 50 $ kilometers, the time it will take is between $ 50 $ and $ 100 $ minutes inclusive, in the absence of any other information. Ah, but you _do_ have other information, namely the times of previous deliveries. It is up to you to use it to produce the best possible estimates.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Multiple test cases. Please process until EOF is reached. For each test case:
The input starts with a line containing an integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \leq 30 $ ) indicating the number of cities, numbered $ 0 $ to $ n-1 $ . After that are $ n $ lines each containing $ n $ integers specifying the distance in kilometers between cities: the $ j^{\text {th}} $ value on the $ i^{\text {th}} $ line indicates the distance when traveling directly from city $ i $ to city $ j $ . A value of $ -1 $ indicates there is no road directly connecting the two cities, and the distance from any city to itself is always $ 0 $ ; all other distances are positive and at most $ 1\, 000 $ . There are at most $ 100 $ roads.
Following this is a line with a single integer $ r $ ( $ 1 \le r \leq 100 $ ) indicating the number of previously executed routes. The next $ r $ lines each contain three integers $ s $ , $ d $ , and $ t $ , where $ s $ and $ d $ are the source and destination cities and $ t $ is how long the delivery from $ s $ to $ d $ took, in minutes.
Finally there is a line containing a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1 \le q \leq 100 $ ) indicating the number of future delivery queries. The next $ q $ lines each contain two integers $ s $ and $ d $ giving the source and destination cities for the query.
You may assume that for each of the $ r+q $ source/destination pairs in the input there is a unique minimum-distance route.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, display a single line for each query containing the source and destination cities for that query, followed by the best low and high bounds on the estimate for the travel time.
**The judge is "ignore FP Rounding up to $ 10^{-2} $ ".**</div>
