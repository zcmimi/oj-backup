<h1>COMFUNC - Commuting Functions</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Two functions f and g (f, g: X → X) are commuting if and only if f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) for each x in X.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input file contains the number of test cases. Each test case is described by a line containing a single integer number n — the number of the elements in the value list of a bijective function f (1</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single line containing n integer numbers — the value list of function g that commutes with the function f and has the lexicographically smallest value list.</div>
