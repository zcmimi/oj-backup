<h1>ENIGMATH - PLAY WITH MATH</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You would have been fed up with competitive programming questions so far, now it is time to solve little math.
Assume you have a equation A \* x - B \* y = 0
For a given value of **A** and **B**, find the minimum positive integer value of **x** and **y** that satisfies this equation.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> First line contains **T**, number of test cases 0 <= **T** <=1000 followed by **T** lines.
First line of each test case contains two space seperated integers **A** and **B**. 1 <= **A**, **B** <=1 000 000 000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case, output a single line containing two integers **x** and **y** (seperated by a single space).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
