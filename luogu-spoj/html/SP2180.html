<div>## 题目描述
三十五年以前，一群超级英雄被选中而组成了正义联盟，以抵抗邪恶、保护地球安全为己任。在帮助了这么多年人类之后，它的成员逐渐开始退休，是时候选择正义联盟的新成员了。
为了保护他们的秘密身份（就让我们这么说吧：“秘密”身份），超级英雄们通常用一个整数代称自己。地球上共有H个超级英雄，分别用数字1-H代称自己。任何人都可以通过瞥一眼报纸而发现哪两个超级英雄合作完成过一次任务。这种情况下，我们称这两个超级英雄是有关系的。
世界上只能有一个正义联盟，它可以被任意数字个超级英雄组成（甚至是一个）。而且，正义联盟中的任意两个成员都必须是有关系的。
另外，也要考虑没有被选入正义联盟的超级英雄们的安排。任意两个没有被选中的超级英雄之间必须没有关系，这是为了防止非官方正义联盟的出现。
你为一家负责创建新正义联盟的机构效力。机构不知道能否按以上要求创建一个新的正义联盟，他们需要你的编程技巧。按照已有的限制，机构将给你一组超级英雄之间的关系，请你决定能否选择出一个新的正义联盟。
## 输入格式
输入由几组数据组成。每组数据的第一行包括两个用空格分开的整数， _H (2 <= H <= 5×10^4)和R(1 <= R <= 10^5 )_ ，分别表示超级英雄的数量和他们之间共有几对关系。接下来的R行各包括两个空格隔开的整数A和B (1 <= A < B <= H)，表示超级英雄A和超级英雄B是互有关系的。一对同样的关系不会在一组数据中重复出现。
输入的结尾由H = R = 0，即两个0组成。
## 输出格式
每组数据输出一行，如果根据已知的条件可以组成新的正义联盟，则输出大写字母“Y”，否则输出大写字母“N"。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Thirty five years ago, a group of super heroes was chosen to form the Justice League, whose purpose was to protect the planet Earth from the villains. After all those years helping mankind, its members are retiring and now it is time to choose the new members of the Justice League.
In order to keep their secret identity, let’s say, secret, super heroes usually use an integer number to identify themselves. There are H super heroes on Earth, identified with the integers from 1 to H. With a brief look at the newspapers anyone can find out if two super heroes have already worked together in a mission. If this happened, we say that the two heroes have a relationship.
There must be only _one_ Justice League in the world, which could be formed by any number of super heroes (even only one). Moreover, for any two heroes in the new league, they _must_ have a _relationship_.
Besides, consider the set of the heroes not chosen to take part in the Justice League. For any two heroes on that set, they _must not_ have a relationship. This prevents the formation of unofficial justice leagues.
You work for an agency in charge of creating the new Justice League. The agency doesn’t know if it is possible to create the League with the restrictions given, and asked for your programming skills. Given a set of super heroes and their relationships, determine if it is possible to select any subset to form the Justice League, according to the given restrictions.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input is composed of several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers separated by a single space, H (2 <= H <= 5×10 $ ^{4} $ ) and R (1 <= R <= 10 $ ^{5} $ ), indicating, respectively, the number of heroes and the number of relationships. Each of the following R lines contains two integers separated by a single space, A and B (1 <= A < B <= H), indicating that super hero A has a relationship with super hero B. Note that if A has a relationship with B, B also has a relationship with A. A relationship is never informed twice on a test case.
The end of input is indicated by H = R = 0.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case in the input print a single line, containing the uppercase letter “Y” if it is possible to select a subset of heroes to form the Justice League according to the given restrictions, or the uppercase letter “N” otherwise.</div>
