<h1>NICEBTRE - Nice Binary Trees</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>For example, the following tree is nice,</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow. Each line contains a string, which represents the pre-order traversal of a “nice” binary tree. Leaves are represented by the letter ‘l’ and other nodes by the letter ‘n’. The input is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of a nice binary tree.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one line for each test case, containing a single integer, the depth of tree.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
