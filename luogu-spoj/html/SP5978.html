<h1>FRQPRIME - Frequent Prime Ranges</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A range \[L..H\] is called a K-Frequent Prime range if there are atleast K primes amongst the numbers L,L+1,..,H. Given N and K, calculate how many subranges of the range \[2..N\] are K-Frequent Prime.
**Input**
The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains 2 integers N and K.
**Output**
Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case, containing the required answer.
**Example**
Sample Input :
4
2 1
5 2
5 1
9 3
Sample Output :
1
4
9
8
Note : For the first test case, the only valid subrange is \[2..2\], whereas for the second test case, the valid subranges are : \[2..3\],\[2..4\],\[2..5\],\[3..5\].
**Constraints**
1 <= T <= 100
2 <= N <= 100000
0 <= K <= 10000</div>
