<h1>CONCAVE - Concave quadrilaterals</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given is a grid consisting of _r_ rows by _c_ columns of grid points.
Count the number of ways in which it is possible to draw a strictly concave quadrilateral with vertices in four of the given grid points.
(A quadrilateral is strictly concave if and only if one of its two diagonals contains a point that is strictly outside the quadrilateral. Shifted and/or rotated copies of the same quadrilateral count as distinct ways of drawing it.)</div>
