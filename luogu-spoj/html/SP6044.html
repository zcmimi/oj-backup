<h1>QCJ4 - Minimum Diameter Circle</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given n points in a plane find the diameter of the smallest circle that encloses all the points. A point lying on the circle is also considered to be inside it</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains the n (<301) the number of points in the plane , followed by n lines of input
Each line gives the coordinates of one point on the plane. Each coordinate is an integer in the range \[0,1000\]</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output consists of a single real number, the diameter of the circle rounded to two decimal places.</div>
