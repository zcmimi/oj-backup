<h1>UCV2013H - Slick</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>一场海难事故导致石油泄漏到费利佩斯顿海域，这是一场严重的自然灾害。Felipistonia政府希望在更多的破坏发生之前清理这个烂摊子。要做到这一点，他们首先必须知道事故的严重程度以及泄漏到海中的石油量。Felipistonia政府唯一需要了解这场灾难严重程度的工具就是使用卫星图像。通过这些图像，他们可以估计他们要花多少钱来清理这个烂摊子。为此，必须知道海洋中的浮游生物的数量和每个浮游生物的大小。浮油是浮在水面上的一块油。不幸的是，Felipistonia的人不是很聪明，所以他们聘请你帮助他们处理形象。 由卫星获得的图像的一个例子如图1（a）所示。如图1（b）所示，此图像可以转换为0和1。给定这个二进制矩阵，你的工作就是计算海洋中的浮游生物的数量和相应的大小。如果图像中的两个相邻像素位于同一行或同一列中，则认为它们位于同一光滑区域内。 </div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A maritime accident has caused oil to spill onto the seas of Felipistonia, which is a major natural disaster. The Felipistonia's government wants to clean up this mess before more damage occurs. To do this, they first have to know how serious was the accident and the amount of oil that has been spilled into the sea. The only instrument the Felipistonia's government has to get information of the magnitude of this disaster, is the use of satellite images. With these images they can estimate how much money they have to spend to clean this mess. For this, the number of slicks in the seas and the size of each slick must be know. A slick is a patch of oil floating on water. Unfortunately, the Felipistonia's people are not very bright, so they have hired you to help them process the image.
An example of an image obtained by the satellites is shown in Figure 1(a). This image can be transformed to 0's and 1's as seen in Figure 1(b). Given this binary matrix, your job is to count the number of slicks in the ocean and their corresponding size. Two adjacent pixels in the image are considered to be in the same slick if they are in the same row or the same column.
![(a) A satellite image of the spilled oil. (b) The representation of the image in a binary matrix](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP15436/24b877f2290e86168568d449b806d33dd084fb11.png)
