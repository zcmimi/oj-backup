<h1>TTABLE - Timetable</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>- 在一些城市间有铁路连接，现在你需要从第一个城市坐火车到最后一个城市。你可以换乘，默认换乘时间为0，但你只能换乘出发时间比当前火车到达时间晚的火车。现在给出每个城市、每趟火车发车的时间，请你求出每种方案的出发时间和到达时间。
- 输入的第一行为测试数据数t，下面是t组数据。每组数据的第一行是一个整数n，表示城市数，下面分别是第1,2,...,n个城市的火车时间表。时间表的第一行包含一个整数m，是从这个城市开出的火车数量。下面m行，每行包含发车的时间、到达的时间、开往的城市。
- 输出的第一行是用时的可能性总数r，下面r行每行包含从第1个城市的出发时间和到达第n个城市的时间。如果两种方案用时一样，你应该只输出并计算一种。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are the owner of a railway system between n cities, numbered by integers from 1 to n. Each train travels from the start station to the end station according to a very specific timetable (always on time), not stopping anywhere between. On each station a departure timetable is available. Unfortunately each timetable contains only direct connections. A passenger that wants to travel from city p to city q is not limited to direct connections however - he or she can change trains. Each change takes zero time, but a passenger cannot change from one train to the other if it departs before the first one arrives. People would like to have a timetable of all optimal connections. A connection departing from city p at A o'clock and arriving in city q at B o'clock is called optimal if there is no connection that begins in p not sooner than at A, ends in q not later than at B, and has strictly shorter travel time than the considered connection. We are only interested in connections that can be completed during same day.
### Task
Write a program that:
- reads the number n and departure timetable for each of n cities from the standard input,
- creates a timetable of optimal connections from city 1 to city n,
- writes the answer to the standard output.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.
For each test case the first line of the input contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100000). The following lines contain n timetables for cities 1, 2, ..., n respectively.
The first line of the timetable description contains only one integer m. Each of the following m lines corresponds to one position in the timetable and contains: departure time A, arrival time B (A < B) and destination city number t (1 <= t <= n) separated by single spaces. Departure time A and arrival time B are written in format hh : mm, where hh are two digits representing full hours (00 <= hh <= 23) and mm are two digits representing minutes (00 <= mm <= 59). Positions in the timetable are given in non-decreasing order according to the departure times. The number of all positions in all timetables does not exceed 1000000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case the first line of the output contains an integer r - the number of positions in the timetable being the solution. Each of the following r lines contains a departure time A and an arrival time B separated by single space. The time format should be like in the input and positions in the timetable should be ordered increasingly according to the departure times. If there is more then one optimal connection with the same departure and arrival time, your program should output just one.</div>
