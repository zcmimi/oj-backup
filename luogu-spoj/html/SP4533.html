<h1>BANDMATR - Determinant of Banded Matrices</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Computing the determinant of a matrix using Gaussian elimination takes O(n^3). On the other hand, computing the determinant of tridiagonal matrix is O(n) using a recurrence. In this problem you will compute the determinant of banded matrices. A band matrix is a sparse matrix, whose non-zero entries are confined to a diagonal band, comprising the main diagonal and zero or more diagonals on either side. In this problem, given a banded **NxN** square integer matrix with **M** bands on each side of the diagonal, we ask you to compute the determinant of this matrix. For example a tridiagonal matrix has exactly 1 band on each side, and the 8x8 Matrix in the sample input has 2 bands on each side. For a good discussion of banded matrices, see Thorson's paper at:
http://sepwww.stanford.edu/oldreports/sep20/20\_11\_abs.html</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A total of <10 inputs. For each input,
First line has dimension, **N (1<N<501)**, of the matrix, followed by **N** lines with **N** integers, each less than **10001**, and greater than **-10001**. It is guarantteed that the number of bands on each side of the diagonal, **M < 51.** That is there are at most **101** bands in total including the diagonal. Use scanf IO, and avoid stl IO.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each input matrix, output its determinant **modulo 10^9+7.**
_Hint:_ Use Montgomery multiplication for fast computation, i.e., see:
