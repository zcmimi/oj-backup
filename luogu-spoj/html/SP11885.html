<h1>BFTRI - Drawing Triangles with Brainf##k</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Your task is just to draw triangles! seems easy(?) but only [brainf\*\*k programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck "Brainf**k") is allowed.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is an integer **T**(0 < **T** < 100), denoting the number of test cases. Then, **T** lines follow.
For each test case, there are one character **c**(ASCII(32) < **c** < ASCII(127)) and one integer **i**(0 < **i** < 100) written in one line, separated by a space. Each line end with ASCII(10).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output triangle size **i** (draw triangle using character **c**). See example.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
