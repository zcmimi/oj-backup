<h1>PITPAIR - Pythagorean Legacy</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> It is necessary to find a minimal integer value R which is equal to the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) of N non-identical rectangular triangles with integer lengths of sides.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> t - number of test cases \[t <= 100\], than t lines follow, each line contains one integer - N, equal to the required number of different rectangular triangles. \[1 <= N <= 2000\]</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case your program should output a number R in a separate line (R fits in a 64-bit integer), equal to the minimal integer value of a hypotenuse for which exactly N different rectangular triangles can be constructed; then in separate lines follow exactly N numbers equal to the shorter cathetus (side adjacent to the right angle) of each of the rectangular triangles, in ascending order.</div>
