<h1>WOWSUBSTR - Counting WOW-Substrings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>```
You are given a string. You have to count the total lengths of all WOW substrings.
WOW substrings are defined as a contiguous substring of a string
where there is no any character occurring more than one times.
That means, all the characters of substring are unique.
As answer could be very large, so print it modulo 100007. (NOTE THAT: 100007 is not a prime number!!)

<div>For each case, print the case number and total lengths of all WOW substrings of given string modulo **100007**.
**Constraints:**
**1<=TC<=50.**
**1<=|S|<=500000. (Length of string)**
**Example**
**Input:** **2** **aaa** **ab** **Output:** **Case** **1: 3** **Case 2: 4**</div>
