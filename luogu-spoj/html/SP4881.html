<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input is a directed (multi)graph.
The first line gives the number of edges M and the number of nodes N (>=2). Then each edge is described by a line of the form "FROM TO LABEL". Nodes (FROM, TO) are numbers in the range 0.. N-1 and labels are also numbers.
All numbers in the input are nonnegative integers <2000.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Print "YES" if there are two distinct walks with the same labelling from node 0 to node 1, otherwise print "NO".</div>
