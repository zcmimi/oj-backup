<h1>FINDMAX - Finding Maximum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> One way of finding the maximum element in an array is to initialize a variable to the first element in the array, iterate through the remaining array, and update the variable whenever a value strictly greater than it is found. Assuming that the array contains N elements each in the range 1..K, how many such arrays exist such that the above algorithm performs exactly P updates? Initialization of the variable is not counted as an update.
For example,the possible arrays for N = 4, K = 3 and P = 2 are:
1) {1,1,2,3}
2\) {1,2,1,3}
3\) {1,2,2,3}
4\) {1,2,3,1}
5\) {1,2,3,2}
6\) {1,2,3,3}</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line contains T the number of test cases. There follow T lines, containing 3 space seperated integers N, K and P.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Output T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output the answer as asked above. Since the answers can get very big, output the answer modulo 1000000007.</div>
