<h1>CAKE3 - Delicious Cake</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Lenka likes to bake cakes since her childhood, when she has learned to bake from her mom. She soon became a cake expert able to bake chocolate cakes, apple pies, muffins, cookies, cheese cakes, tortes and many other cakes.
Recently, she has started her studies of math at Comenius University in Bratislava. In the first year she is taking combinatorics class. Today she is studying for the final exam. Since the brain needs a lot of sugar to study math, she has baked, just for herself, her favorite, very delicious, strawberry cake.
The cake, still hot, is lying on an **N**×**M** inch sheet pan. Hungrily waiting for the cake to cool off Lenka came up with an interesting combinatorial question: How many different possibilities to cut the cake are there so that every connected piece consists of some number of 1×1 inch unit squares?</div>
