<div>**Beautiful Factorial Game**
The statement of this problem is very simple. Given two number n and k, you need to find the maximum power of k (i.e. x) such that n! % k^x = 0. Here n! is the notation of n factorial. If you are not familiar with the notation,
n! = 1 \* 2 \* 3 \* 4 \* 5 \* 6 ….. \* n
**Input:**
First line of the input will contain an integer t (1 <= t <= 20) denoting the number of test case. The next t lines contain two integer number n and k as described above.
**Constraints:**
For easy version, 1 <= n <= 10, 2 <= k <= 10
For harder version, 1 <= n <= 100000000, 2 <= k <= 100000000
**Output:**
For each test case, print “Case t: x” where t is the test case number and x is the maximum power of k for which n! % k^x = 0.
**Sample Input**
**Output of sample input**
2
5 2
1000 2
Case 1: 3
Case 2: 994
**Explanation of the sample:**
In the first test case, n = 5 and k = 2. So, n! = 120.
n! % 2^0 = 0
n! % 2^1 = 0
n! % 2^2 = 0
n! % 2^3 = 0
n! % 2^4 = 8
n! % 2^5 = 24
n! % 2^6 = 56
n! % 2^7 = 120
So, the answer should be 3.
