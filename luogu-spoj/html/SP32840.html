<h1>ADADIG - Ada and Digits</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer and she also loves math. One day, as farming is sometimes very notorious work, she was thinking about numbers. She was wondering about how many numbers there are having exactly same digital sum as digital product.
She have found out some answers for small **N** (sum & product), but then the numbers started getting big. Can you help her to find out the answers for bigger sums to satisfy her mind?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer **1 , number of test-cases.**
Each of the next line contains a single number **1 , the required sum (and so the required product).**</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test-case, print the number of existing numbers. Since this number might be pretty huge, output it modulo **10 $ ^{9} $ +7** (**1000000007**).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
