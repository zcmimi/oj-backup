<h1>HOMEW - Homework</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>When trying to clean your old room, you find out your old notes from high school.
Reading the homeworks you were given then, you start thinking how much easier they
would have been today. However, there is a particular one that still seems to maintain
its difficulty.
When the solution to a problem involved solving the square root of an integer, to keep
a fancy and clean expression, you were asked to express it as the integer part and the
root part. This means that if you had as solution N you were asked to express it
as √N = A √B with the part A being as high as possible. For instance, 180 can be
expressed as 1 √180, 2 √45, 3 √20 or 6 √5. Of course, the last expression is the correct
one.
Now that you are grown up, you decide to write a program to perform this task for you.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input contains several test cases, each one described in a single line. The line contains
an integer N (1 not be processed as a test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a single line with two integers A and B separated by a single
space such that √N = A √B and A is maximum.</div>
