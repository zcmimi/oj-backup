<h1>NSTEPS - Number Steps</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>如下图，将自然数0，1，2，…写在平面直角坐标系内，问在点（x，y）处是否写了一个数，如果有，输出这个数，否则输出“No Number”。

例如1写在（1，1），2写在（2，0），3写在（3，1）。
输入格式：第1行一个数N，有N组测试数据。 接下来N行，每行一组测试数据，2个数x，y，表示点（x，y）。（0<=x，y<=10000）
输出格式：N行，每行一组测试数据，1个数或“No Number”。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Starting from point (0,0) on a plane, we have written all non-negative integers 0, 1, 2,... as shown in the figure. For example, 1, 2, and 3 has been written at points (1,1), (2,0), and (3, 1) respectively and this pattern has continued.

You are to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x, y), and writes the number (if any) that has been written at that point. (x, y) coordinates in the input are in the range 0...10000.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem. In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the coordinates (x, y) of a point.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each point in the input, write the number written at that point or write No Number if there is none.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>3
4 2
6 6
3 4</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
