<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** lines follow, each of which contains space-separated integers **L**, **P** and **C** in that order.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of load tests you need to run in the worst case before knowing within a factor of **C** how many people the site can support.</div>
