There is a rabbit in the cell containing number 1. A rabbit can jump to a neighboring cell (up, down, left or right) if that cell exists.
Given K valid rabbit jumps, write a program that will calculate the sum of numbers of all cells that rabbit visited (add the number to the sum each time rabbit visits the same cell).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains two integers N and K (1 000, 1 000), the size of the matrix and the number of rabbit jumps.
The second line contains a sequence of K characters 'U', 'D', 'L' and 'R', describing the direction of each jump. The sequence of jumps will not leave the matrix at any moment.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one integer, the sum of numbers on visited cells.
**Note:** This number doesn't always fit in 32-bit integer type.</div>
