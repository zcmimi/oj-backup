<h1>GRIDSUM3 - 2x2 Subgrid Sum Problem (generalized)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>This problem is a higher constraints and generalized version of [KWACIK](http://pl.spoj.com/problems/KWACIK/) (Polish) and [GRIDSUM2](../GRIDSUM2/).
![Sample case for k=5, a=1, b=3 and n=8.](../../../content/min_25:grid_5x5.png "Sample case for k=5, a=1, b=3 and n=8.")
You are given a **_k_**x**_k_** grid. You can place an integer _m_ (**_a_** m **b**) in each cell.
How many ways are there to place integers in the cells such that the sum of each 2x2 subgrid is _**n**_ ?
Since the answer might be very large, output it modulo **479001600** (= **12!**).</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains an integer **_T_** (1 **T**
On each of the next **_T_** lines, you are given four integers **_k_**, _**a**_, **_b_** and _**n**_.
(2 _k_ _a_ _b_ _n_</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to place integers modulo **479001600** (= **12!**).</div>
