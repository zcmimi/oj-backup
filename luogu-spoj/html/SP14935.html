<h1>CAC - Cactus</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a spanning tree T of a connected, undirected graph</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line of input will be the number of test cases. Each test case will start with a two numbers N and E where N is the number of vertices of the cactus graph, vertices are numbered from 1 to N, 3 <= N <= 81 and E is the number of edges in the graph, 2 <= E <= 120. The next E lines each one will have two numbers v and w and that means there is an edge between vertix v and w.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case print “Case C: X” without quotes where C is the case number starting with 1 and X is the number of ways you can convert the given cactus graph to a spanning tree.</div>
