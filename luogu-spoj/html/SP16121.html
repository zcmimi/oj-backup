<h1>NITK06 - MODIFY SEQUENCE</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Suppose we have a sequence of non-negative integers, Namely a $ _{1} $ , a $ _{2} $ , ..., a $ _{n} $ . At each time we can choose one term a $ _{i} $ with 0 < i < n and we subtract 1 from both a $ _{i} $ and a $ _{i+1} $ . We wonder whether we can get a sequence of all zeros after several operations.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is the number of test cases T (0 < T <= 20).
The first line of each test case is a number N (0 < N <= 10000). The next line is N non-negative integers, 0 <= a $ _{i} $ <= 10 $ ^{9} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>If it can be modified into all zeros with several operations output “YES” in a single line, otherwise output “NO” instead.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>2
