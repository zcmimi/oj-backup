<h1>FPLAN - Field Plan</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>World Soccer Championship is coming soon and coach Yogi wants to prepare his team as well as possible. So he made up a strategy field plan for every player of the team. One plan describes a number of possible locations for the player on the field. Moreover, if Yogi wants the player to be able to move from one location _A_ to another location _B_ then the plan specifies the ordered pair _(A,B)_. He is sure that his team will win if the players run over the field from one location to another using only moves of the plan.
![example image](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP6825/794ab372d2a1757ad780338c501382778b616847.png)
Yogi tells every player to follow his plan and to start from a location that reaches every other location on the plan (by possibly multiple moves). However, it is quite difficult for some soccer players, simple minded as they are, to find a suitable starting location. Can you help every player to figure out the set of possible start locations?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line gives the number of field plans. The input contains at most eleven field plans (what else?). Every plan starts with a line of two integers _N_ and _M_, with _1 and _1 , giving the number of locations and the number of moves. In the following _M_ lines a plan specifies moves _(A,B)_ by two white space separated integers _0 . The plans are separated by a blank line.___</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For every plan print out all possible starting locations, sorted increasingly and one per line. If there are no possible locations to start, print **Confused**. Print a blank line after each plan output.</div>
