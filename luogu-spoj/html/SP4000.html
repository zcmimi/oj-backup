<h1>GALLUP - GALLUP</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Often, we see results of gallups, like this: Prefer red: 3.5% Prefer green: 4.5% Prefer yellow: 22.0% Prefer blue: 70.0% and you begin to wonder: how many people did they really ask? If the numbers are simple, like 20%, 40%, and 40%, you know that they asked 5 people (or 10, or 15, or more, but we are interested in the minimum number of people). Your task is to write a program that reads sets of percentages and calculates the smallest number of people that could produce the given percentages. We know that this number is always less than 10 000.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input is a set of percentages. Each set is on a line of its own. Every line starts with an integer n (0 <= n <= 20) giving the number of percentages in the set. If n > 0, the percentages follow as n numbers; these numbers may have 0–5 decimals, and all percentages in a set have the same number of decimals. (If there are no decimals, there is no decimal point.) The percentages always add up to about 100% as there may be small rounding errors. Numbers are rounded when digits are removed; they are rounded upwards if the first removed digit is 5 or more. Thus, 4.472 is rounded to 4.47, 4.5, or 4, depending on how many digits you want.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each set of data, print a line starting with “Case i :”, where “i” is the data set’s number. Then follows a space and an integer giving the computed number of people. If no legal answer in the range 1–9999 exists, print “error” instead of the number.</div>
