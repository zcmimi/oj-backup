<h1>DSUBSEQ - Distinct Subsequences</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Given a string, count the number of distinct subsequences of it ( including empty subsequence ). For the uninformed, A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
For example, "AGH" is a subsequence of "ABCDEFGH" while "AHG" is not.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line of input contains an integer T which is equal to the number of test cases. You are required to process all test cases. Each of next T lines contains a string s.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output consists of T lines. Ith line in the output corresponds to the number of distinct subsequences of ith input string. Since, this number could be very large, you need to output ans%1000000007 where ans is the number of distinct subsequences.</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
