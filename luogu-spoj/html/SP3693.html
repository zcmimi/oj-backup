<h1>KGSS - Maximum Sum</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> You are given a sequence A\[1\], A\[2\], ..., A\[N\] ( 0 ≤ A\[i\] ≤ 10^8 , 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5 ). There are two types of operations and they are defined as follows: **Update:** This will be indicated in the input by a 'U' followed by space and then two integers i and x.
**U i x**, 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and x, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^8.
This operation sets the value of A\[i\] to x.
**Query:** This will be indicated in the input by a 'Q' followed by a single space and then two integers i and j.
**Q x y**, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ N.
You must find i and j such that x ≤ i, j ≤ y and i != j, such that the sum A\[i\]+A\[j\] is maximized. Print the sum A\[i\]+A\[j\].
### Input
The first line of input consists of an integer **N** representing the length of the sequence. Next line consists of N space separated integers A\[i\]. Next line contains an integer **Q**, Q ≤ 10^5, representing the number of operations. Next Q lines contain the operations.
### Output
Output the maximum sum mentioned above, in a separate line, for each Query.
### Example
```
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5
6
Q 2 4
Q 2 5
U 1 6
Q 1 5
U 1 7
Q 1 5
Output:
7
9
11
12
```
