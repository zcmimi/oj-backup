<h1>BEGIN - Begin</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Begin a sequence of distinct natural numbers Ni , i = 0, 1, 2,... , with the number B (= N0) ; generate numbers Ni , i = 1, 2,... , recursively and end the sequence with the last generated number E . The characteristic of numbers and the process for generation are stated below:
\* Each number in the sequence contains an even number of decimal digits and is of the form f1d1f2d2fk...dk where d1, d2,..., dk , are k distinct digits in increasing order and each fj is a non-zero digit.
\* For i = 0, 1, 2,... , if Ni = f1d1f2d2...fkdk then Ni+1 = F1D1F2D2...FKDK , where K$ \\ge$k ; D1, D2,..., DK , are distinct digits that occur in Ni and appear in increasing order in Ni+1 ; and FJ is the frequency of DJ in Ni , for J = 1, 2,..., K . For example if Ni = 102335 then Ni+1 = 1011122315 .
Write a program to find for a given E , the longest sequence of numbers that ends with E and begins with the smallest B .
Again consider an example; if E =1011122315 then the required sequence of numbers is 303355 103325 1011122315.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The input may contain multiple test cases.
Each test case contains only one input, viz., E .
The input terminates when a line containing 0 appears as a test case.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case, print the longest sequence of numbers that ends with E and begins with the smallest B . Use space to separate two consecutive numbers in the sequence.</div>
