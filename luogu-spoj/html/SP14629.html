<h1>HAP01 - Play with Binary Numbers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Let S be the binary representation of an Integer. We define two functions a(i) and b(i) such that
a(i) = Number of occurrences of '1' at odd positions of S.
b(i) = Number of occurrences of '1' at even positions of S.
For example: for integer 19, S=10011.
so, a(19)=2 and b(19)=1</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line contains an integer T. T=Number of test cases. Then T lines follow
On each line, you will be given three integers M,N,K.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a single integer R.
Where, R is the number of integers 'i' between M and N(both inclusive) such that absolute difference of a(i) and b(i) is equal to K.
Answer of each each test case should be on separate line</div>
