<h1>TSPAGAIN - Travelling Salesman Again !</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>There are N cities numbered from 0..N-1. A salesman is located at city 0. He wishes to visit all cities exactly once and return back to city 0. There are K toll booths. Each toll booth has a certain range of functioning. The parameters for toll k are given as x\_k and y\_k. If the salesman travels from city i to j, he has to pay 1 dollar toll fee to each toll p having x\_p >= i and y\_p <= j. Calculate the cheapest way for the salesman to complete his tour.
Input :
The first line contains T the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and K. Each of the next K lines contains 2 integers, the ith line containing x\_i and y\_i (0 <= x\_i,y\_i < N). A blank line seperates two test cases.
Output :
Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer.
Sample Input :
2
3 2
2 0
0 2
3 4
1 0
2 1
0 1
1 2
Sample Output :
3
