<h1>KINDERPC - Kindergarten Painting Competition </h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>One of the most anxiously awaited occasions in any school is its annual day. Great excitement and hurried activities are visible all around. The prize-winners and those who are participating in the cultural programme are especially elated.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow, one for each test case. Each line contains an integer N, denoting the number of students.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output one line for each test case, containing two integers.
The first should be the number ways of seating the participants in the front row, so that none of them feel inferior. As this number can be very large, output it modulo 1000000007 (i.e. 10 $ ^{9&nbsp;} $ + 7).
The second should be the greatest integer less than or equal to the expected number of participants who will feel inferior if they are seated randomly.</div>
