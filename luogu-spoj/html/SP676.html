<h1>LSORT - Sorting is not easy</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> An N-element permutation is an N-element sequence of distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, ...,n}. For example the sequence 2,1,4,5,3 is a 5-element permutation. P is an N-element permutation. Your task is to sort P in ascending order. But because it is very simple, I have a new rule for you. You have two sequences P and Q. P is an N-element permutation and Q is initially empty and formed by sorting P (i.e. finally Q = 1, 2, 3,... , N). You have to implement N steps to sort P. In the i-th step, P has N-i+1 remaining elements, Q has i-1 elements and you have to choose some x-th element (from the N-i+1 available elements) of P and put it to the left or to the right of Q. The cost of this step is equal to _x \* i_. The total cost is the sum of costs of individual steps. After N steps, Q must be an ascending sequence. Your task is to minimize the total cost.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of the input file is T (T ≤ 10), the number of test cases. Then descriptions of T test cases follow. The description of each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1000). The second line contains N distinct integers from the set {1, 2, .., N}, the N-element permutation P.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> For each test case your program should write one line, containing a single integer - the minimum total cost of sorting.</div>
