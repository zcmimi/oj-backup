<h1>MPOLY - Polygon</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>[English](/problems/MPOLY/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MPOLY/vn/) There are N points in a plane whose coordinates are natural numbers. A convex polygon with maximal number of vertices is a convex polygon whose vertices are some of given points and the origin having maximal possible number of vertices. Origin, i.e. point with coordinates (0,0), must be one of vertices of a convex polygon with maximal number of vertices.
Write a program that will determine number of vertices in such polygon.
A polygon is convex if every line segment whose endpoints are inside that polygon is also completely inside it. Consecutive edges of a polygon must not be parallel.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first line of input file contains a natural number N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100, a number of given points.
Each of the following N lines contains two natural numbers X and Y, 1 ≤ X ≤ 100, 1 ≤ Y ≤ 100, separated by a space character, coordinates of one point.
All points will be different.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The first and only line of output file should contain number of vertices of convex polygon with maximal number of vertices. Note: the result will always be at least 3.</div>
