<h1>COMBAT - Air Combat</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>An air combat is on the way, you are asked to command this war. Now planes of enemy are full of the sky. A plane is described with three-dimensional coordinate (x, y, z)(1000<x, y, z<1200), and all coordinates are integers. As is show below: ![](../../content/fameoflight:1.jpg "Example ") You have created a missile which can destroy all the planes in a cube whose center is (x, y, z), and the cube can be as large as (x-r, y-r, z-r) (x+r, y+r, z+r). This missile is so fierce that it will destroy not only enemy in that space, but also friends. And after that a position is occupied by a plane belongs to the opposite side before the explosion, that is to say an enemy plane will be replaced by a friend, a friend will be replaced by an enemy. You want to reduce our loss, so you need to know which side a plane belongs to in a position. ![](file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/ADMINI%7E1/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot.png)</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains the number of scenarios.
For each scenario you are given a line containing x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2, defining the two corners A(x1, y1, z1), B(x2, y2, z2) (1000<= x1<x2, y1<y2, z1<z2 <=1200) of the sky. The combat is so fierce that every point in the cube is occupied by an enemy plane at first. Next line is a number of operation q. Next q lines: (0<q<10000) A character ‘U’: followed by 4 integers, a center point M(xi, yi, zi) ,the range is ri. A character ‘Q’: followed by 3 integers, a position N(xi, yi, zi), if a plane belongs to us, print ”Friend” else print ”Enemy”. Points M and N are all in cube given above.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>

<div>Print a line for every ‘Q’ operation.</div>
