<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>On a faraway planet, strange plants with two stems can be found. Every plant on the planet can be described by three numbers: the x-coordinates of the stems L and R, and the height H at which the stems are connect. The image depicts a plant with L=2, R=5 and H=4.

Every day a new plant grows on the planet. The plant that grows on day 1 is of height 1, and every subsequent plant is one higher than the previous one.
When a stem of a new plant intersects the horizontal segment of another plant, a small flower grows (if one wasn't there already). If segments merely touch in a point, a flower will not grow there. The following images are a visualization of the first example.
