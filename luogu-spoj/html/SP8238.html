<h1>NFACTOR - N-Factorful</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A number is called **n**-factorful if it has exactly **n** distinct prime factors. Given positive integers **a**, **b**, and **n**, your task is to find the number of integers between **a** and **b**, inclusive, that are **n**-factorful. We consider 1 to be 0-factorful.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Your input will consist of a single integer **T** followed by a newline and **T** test cases. Each test cases consists of a single line containing integers **a**, **b**, and **n** as described above.
**T** > 10000
1 a b $ ^{6} $
0 n</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output for each test case one line containing the number of **n**-factorful integers in \[**a**, **b**\].</div>
