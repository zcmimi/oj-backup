<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Kutus loves even number. Girl friend of kutus, name putus makes an interesting</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Input start with an integer T, which denotes the number of test case. Each case contains 2 space separated integer N and Q denoting the size of array A and the number of queries to be performed.
Next line contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A. Each of the next Q lines of input contains a query having one of the mentioned three types. There will be no more than fifty update operation (type 0 & type 1).</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each case print the case number and print the answer. If all elements frequency in the range L to R is/are even, then answer will be ‘Yes’ otherwise answer will be ‘No’.
