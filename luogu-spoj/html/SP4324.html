<h1>EVERLAST - The fate of the pineapple</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>为了改善火星地形，宇航员带来了N（0＜N＜5）幼小的健康菠萝树。
这种特殊的菠萝以如下方式无性繁殖：
一株菠萝树在一个生长期内产生k个新的菠萝（0＜K＜15）。
在生长期结束时，新菠萝成熟了，而老菠萝枯萎了。
辐射的增加对在火星上种植的任何新菠萝都有P（0＜P<＝1）的杀菌概率。每个菠萝都单独计算这种概率。
菠萝种族永远不会灭绝的概率是多少？
输入输出格式
输入格式： 第一行是样例数量（不超过10^ 5）。下面的每一行描述了一个样例。整数n和k和十进制数p由单个空格分隔。
输出格式： 一行输出一个答案。每一行都输出最终存活率，保留两位小数，并用百分号表示。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In order to help terraform Mars, astronauts have brought (among other things) N (0<=N<5) young, healthy pineapple plants.
This particular type of pineapple reproduces asexually in the following way:
1. A single pineapple plant produces K (0<=K<15) new pineapple in one growing season.
2. At the end of the growing season, the new pineapples are adults, and the old ones are dead.
3. Increased levels of radiation have a P (0<=P<=1) chance of sterilizing any new pineapple that develops on Mars. This probability is independent for each pineapple.
What is the probability that the pineapple population will never die out?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line is the number of test cases (no more than 10^5). Each of the following lines describes a test case. The integers N and K and the decimal number P are separated by single spaces.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There will be one line for each test case. Each line will have the probability of eventual survival in percent, to two decimals, followed by the percent sign.</div>
