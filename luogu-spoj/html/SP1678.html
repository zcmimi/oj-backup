<h1>TREASURY - Royal Treasury</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div># 题目描述
在很久很久以前的一个王国里，王国的财产开始变得越来越少。国王决定改变这种情况，然后他发明了一种新的系统。系统职员要求两两成对（为了避免行贿），每一对由一个职员及他的下属组成。你的任务就是在满足这种组成方式结构的前提下，计算出能够按照这种方式组成的最大的对数，和可能的方法数。 任务 这项任务是由George Skinflint领导的。每个职员都有0个,1个或者更多的下属，并且每个职员都只有一个单独的上司（除了George Skinglint）。职员的人数不会超过1 000。你的任务就是，按照由职员及他的下属组成的方法，计算出能够组成的对数的最大值。另外，你也要计算最大值可能的组成的方式有多少种。注意一些职员不需要成对。
# 输入格式
第一行包含一个数字N，表示职员的数目，1≤N≤1 000。职员按照特殊的ID号码进行标号，号码为1~N。Skinflint的号码为1。接下来N行对应相应的职员：包含其ID号和一个数字K表示他的下属的数目，0≤K≤999，接下来给出他的K个职员的ID号，中间由空格分隔。并且保证所有职员不会比他的上司先出现。
# 输出格式
输出包含两行。第一行包含一个单独的数字，代表职员能形成的最多的对数。第二行表示在多数最多的情况下，有多少种形成方式。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Once upon a time in a kingdom far far away, the royal treasury started getting emptier and emptier. The king decided to change the situation and he invented a new system of cooperation with in the office of the royal treasurer. The clerks of the office are supposed to form pairs (in order to avoid being bribed) in such away that each pair is formed by a clerk and his/her direct subordinate. Your task is to compute, given the structure of the office of the treasurer, the maximum number of pairs that can be formed this way and in how many different ways this is possible.
The office of the treasurer is led by George Skinflint. Each clerk has zero, one or more subordinates and is a subordinate of a single clerk (except for George Skinflint who is responsible only to the king himself). The number of clerks does not exceed 1000. Your task is to compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed by clerks in such a way that every pair is formed by a clerk and his/her direct subordinate. In addition, you should also compute the number of ways such pairs can be formed. Note that some clerks need not be contained in a pair.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>**The input contains multiple testcases.**
The first line of each testcase contains a single number N that represents the number of clerks 1 <= N <= 1000. The clerks are assigned unique ID numbers from the range between 1 and N. The ID number of the treasurer (Skinflint) is 1. Each of the following N lines corresponds to one of the clerks: it contains his/her ID number, the number K of his/her subordinates, 0 <= K <= 999, and the ID numbers of his/her K subordinates separated by single spaces. You can assume that the line corresponding to a clerk never appears before the line corresponding to his/her supervisor.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The output for each testcase should consist of two lines. The first line of the output should contain a single number that represents the maximum number M of pairs that the clerks can form. The second line should contain the number of different ways in which the clerks can form M pairs obeying the rules given by the king.</div>
