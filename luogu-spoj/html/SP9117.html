<h1>GCPC11A - Faculty Dividing Powers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Fred Faculty and Paul Power love big numbers. Day after day Fred chooses a random integer _n_ and he computes _n!_. His friend Paul amuses himself by computing several powers of his randomly chosen integer _k_ like _k $ ^{2} $_ , _k $ ^{3} $_ and so on. On a hot summer day, Fred and Paul got really, really bored, so they decided to play a joke on their buddy Dave Divider. Fred chooses a random integer _n_ while Paul chooses a random integer _k_. They want Dave to find the biggest integer _i_ such that _k $ ^{i} $_ divides _n!_ without a remainder, otherwise they will throw a cake in Dave's face. Because Dave does not like cakes in his face, he wants you to help him finding that integer _i_.</div>
