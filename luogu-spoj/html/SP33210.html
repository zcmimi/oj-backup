<h1>ADACUT - Ada and Alley</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>正如你可能已经知道的一样，瓢虫Ada是一个农民。她有一条林荫大道。她希望这条大道看上去很好，所以她决定让所有树的高度相等。她有两种可能的操作：她可以砍掉一棵树的顶端，把它的高度降低一点（代价为1），或者把树砍倒（代价为这棵树的高度）。请求出让所有树的高度相等的最小的花费。

<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She has a long alley of trees. She wants the alley to look good so she has decided to make the heights of all trees equal. She has two possible operations: she can either cut the top of a tree, decreasing its height by one (at cost of **1**) **or** cut the tree down (at cost of **height $ _{i} $** ).</div>
