<h1>BLUEEQ2 - Help Blue Mary Please! (Act II)</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Today Mary's math homework is to solve an equation.
![](../../../content/john_jones:blueeq2a.bmp)
She knows all ki and pi, and 1<=xi<=M. All xi must be integers. She must work out the number of different solutions of this equation this day.Can you give her a hand?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There is a single integer T in the very first line of the input denoted the number of tests.T blocks follow.
For each test case:
The first line contains a single integer n(n<=6).The second line contains a single integer m(m<=150).n lines follow,each contains two space-separated integers ki and pi, i=1,2,...,n. All pi are positive.

<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output a single line ,which contains a single integer - the answer.You may assume this number is less than 2^31.</div>
