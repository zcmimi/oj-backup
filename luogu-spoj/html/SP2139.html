<h1>GOSSIPER - Gossipers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Doulnee Keltchow is a small town in the middle of nowhere; what makes it so famous is the number of gossipers who live there. Every morning, each gossiper finds out a new gossip, a gossip so unique that nobody else in the town knows it. The gossipers talk, gossip and exchange rumors all day long. What happens when two gossipers meet? Of course, they exchange all the gossips they have heard so far. Your task is to determine whether every gossiper will know all the gossips by the end of the day.</div>
