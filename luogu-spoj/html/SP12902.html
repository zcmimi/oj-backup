<h1>DCEPCA01 - Good Luck </h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>A number is called lucky if it consists of only digits 4 and 7 ie. 4, 7, 44, 47 are lucky numbers while 3, 45, 4478 are not lucky. For a given lucky number the functions F(i) and G(i) are defined as follows
F(i) = the number of 4’s from 0 $ ^{th} $ to i $ ^{th} $ position in the number including positions 0 and i.
G(i) = the number of 7’s from 0 $ ^{th} $ to i $ ^{th} $ position in the number including positions 0 and i.
Let H(i)= absolute(F(i)-F(i+1)-F(i+2)+F(i+3))
A "Dynamic Number" is a lucky number which has maximum of summation(H(i)) from i = 0 to n-4 amongst all lucky numbers of length N.
Given a number N , you need to find out the sum of the two smallest Dynamic Numbers of length N.If only one Dynamic Number is possible, then only that number is the answer.
Note : Most significant bit is defined as the 0 $ ^{th} $ position of the number.</div>
