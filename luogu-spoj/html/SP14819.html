<h1>PERMTGEN - Permutation Generator</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Hasan Jaddouh has invented a new algorithm for generating permutations this algorithm takes an array with length N as input and generate a permutation with length N from this array.
the array must satsify (1 <= Ai <= i) in order for the resulting array to be a permutation.
and here is the pseudo code of the algorithm:
```
read N
for i=1 to N do
read A[i]
for i=1 to N do
for j=1 to i-1 do
if A[j] >= A[i] do
A[j]=A[j]+1
for i=1 to N do
print A[i]
```
but unfortunately for Hasan Jaddouh, his algorithm is too slow for big arrays so he asked you to help him to find a fast way to implement his algorithm.
your program should read input same as the pseudo code and output the new array</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>first line contains integer N (1 <= N <= 10 $ ^{5} $ )
second line contains N integers separated by spaces each interger is between 1 and 10 $ ^{9} $ inclusive
**note:** in order for Hasan Jaddouh's algorithm to work and generate a permutation the constrain (1 <= Ai <= i) must be satsified but to make this problem harder this constrian is **not** guaranteed so it's also not necessary that the output is a permutation.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>Output N integers separated by spaces, the new array after applying Hasan Jaddouh's algorithm</div>
