<h1>HPYNOS - Happy Numbers I</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>The process of “**breaking**” an integer is defined as summing the squares of its digits. For example, the result of breaking the integer **125** is (**1 $ ^{2} $** + **2 $ ^{2} $** + **5 $ ^{2} $** ) = **30**. An integer **N** is **happy** if after “**breaking**” it repeatedly the result reaches 1. If the result never reaches 1 no matter how many times the “**breaking**” is repeated, then N is not a happy number.
**TASK**
Write a program that given an integer N, determines whether it is a happy number or not.
**CONSTRAINTS**
2 N</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line containing a single integer **N**.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>A single line containing a single integer **T** which is the number of times the process had to be done to determine that N is happy, or **-1** if **N** is not happy.</div>
