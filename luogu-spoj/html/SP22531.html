<h1>YOYOCQM - Yo Yo Jagdish Singh</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Like many teenagers of his age, Jagdish is into Honey Singh these days, and has decided to enter a rapping contest. A rap song can be represented as a single word of uppercase characters (A-Z). The contest assigns score based on the smallest length word which is not a substring of the song. The participant with the highest score gets a chance to meet with Honey Singh.
Jagdish is pumped up about this, and starts writing his song. He asks Anandi for help. Anandi being a Heavy Metal fan, dislikes the whole idea. However, she ends up helping Jagdish by evaluating his songs by finding a string (containing uppercase letters) with smallest length which is not a substring of the song. If multiple strings of same lengths are present, the lexicographically smallest one is considered as the result. Help Anandi find such string.
**Input**
Each line represents an input, consisting of a string (made up of uppercase characters A-Z). Read till EOF
**Output** For each input, output the result string.
**Constraints**
There will be 100 test cases.
1<= Length of input string <= 10^4
**Sample Input** ABCD
BBB
**Sample Output**
