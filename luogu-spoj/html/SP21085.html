<h1>TPCPALIN - Palindrome Merge</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/TPCPALIN/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/TPCPALIN/vn/)Given two strings s1 and s2. We can merge characters of two strings (with order in original strings) to get a new string.
For example : s1 = 'ab' and s2 = 'ba'.
We can merge to get st = 'a**b**b**a**' but not st = 'a**ab**b'.
**The Problem :** Given two string contain only lowercase letters, count the number of palindrome by merging in different ways.
Ex : 'aba', 'abba' are palindrome, 'abc' and 'abca' aren't.</div>
