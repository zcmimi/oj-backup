<h1>NACCI - Nacci Fear</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>We all know about the classical fibonaaci series, Fibonacci series is F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2). For this question we call it a 2-Nacci series as a new element is calculated as the sum of the last 2 terms of the series. For fibonaaci we assume F(0)=0 and F(1)=1. We define as new series N-Nacci where F(n) is the sum of the last n terms and here we assume that F(0)=0, F(1)=1,F(2)=2... F(n-1)=(n-1). Your task is to calculate the last K digits of the Lth term of the N-Nacci series(no leading zeros needed).
Constraints
2<=N<=30
K<=8
L<=1000000000</div>
