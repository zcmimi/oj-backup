<h1>MULTIPLY - Fast Multiplication Again</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>题目描述：
当你在尝试用一些支持任意大整数和超时的脚本语言解决31号问题（快速乘法）后，就会想知道进行整数快速乘法的最佳语言是什么。你自然会想到：当然是 brainf**k，因为只有这种语言有非常快速的操作。
输入格式： 两个正整数，每个以换行符（ASCII 码 为 10）结尾。
输出格式： 两个整数的乘积，以换行符结尾。你可以认为这个数字小于 10000。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> After trying to solve Problem Number 31 (Fast Multiplication) with some script languages that support arbitrary large integers and timing out, you wonder what would be the best language to do fast multiplication of integers. And naturally it comes to your mind: Of course it is brainf\*\*k, because there are only very cheap operations in that language.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div> Two positive integers, ended with a line feed (ASCII 10) each.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div> The product of the two integers, terminated by a line feed. You may assume that this number will be less than 10000.</div>
