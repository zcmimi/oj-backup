<h1>SHOOTING - Emmons</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>After the end of all the shooting competitions in XXIX Olympic Games in Beijing, Matthew Emmons will be known to more and more people because of his last - which is also his worst - shooting in the 50m Rifle 3\*40 Men competitions. Four years before in Athens, he shot a wrong target and lost the gold metal which is almost at hands in the 50m Rifle 3\*40 Men competition.
**The following is Blue Mary's imagination :P**
Emmons decides to practise shooting more assiduously. Because he is an excellent shooter, only 1 year later, he can even shoot precisely without collimation! To him, getting the gold metal of 50m Rifle 3\*40 Men in XXX Olympic Games doesn't have any difficulty now.
His wife - Katerina Emmons, also a well-known excellent shooter - make a game to keep his interests with shot. The player has _n_ (1<= _n_ <=2000) bullets, each one has a value (a integer whose absolute value is less than 10000). There are _m_ (1<= _m_ <= _n_) targets, each with a point counter next to it. In the beginning of the game, all the counter are set to integer 1.
During the game, the player must choose a bullet and shoot any target. He must use all the bullet, each with at least(of course, at most) 1 time. And each target must be shot at least one time.
If the player shoot a target with a bullet valued **X**, the counter of the target will multiplied by **X**.
The final score of the game is sum of all the _m_ counters.
Now Matthew needs your help to make his final score as high as possible. After that, he will show you his excellent shooting skills to get this score.
**P.S.** Even the things above is my imagination, I hope Matthew Emmons has good luck and wins the gold metal of 50m Rifle 3\*40 Men in XXX Olympics in London.</div>
