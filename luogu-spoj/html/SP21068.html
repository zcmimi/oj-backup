<h1>TPCPPLAR - Popular</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div> [English](/problems/TPCPPLAR/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/TPCPPLAR/vn/)Given a directed graph G , N vertices and M arcs.
A node X called "acessible" to Y if there is a path from X to Y
A node X called "popular" if every node Y in V fulfill one of two conditions :
1\. X is acessible to Y
2\. Y is acessible to X
The Problem : Given graph G, count the number of popular node.
Input
\- The first line contain N and M, the number of nodes and arcs (1 <= N <= 150000; 1 <= M <= 300000)
\- M next lines, each line contains x and y, there is a arcs connect from x to y.
Output
\- First line print number of popular nodes.
\- Second line print populars node in increasing order.
Example
Input:
5 4
1 2
3 2
2 4
4 5
Output:
3
2 4 5</div>
