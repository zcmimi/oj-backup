<h1>NSUBSTR - Substrings</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>你得到一个字符串，最多由25万个小写拉丁字母组成。我们将 F(x)定义为某些长度X的字符串在s中出现的最大次数，例如字符串'ababaf'- F(x)，因为有一个字符串'ABA'出现两次。你的任务是输出 F(x)每一个I，以使1<=i<=|S|.</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You are given a string S which consists of 250000 lowercase latin letters at most. We define F(x) as the maximal number of times that some string with length x appears in S. For example for string 'ababa' F(3) will be 2 because there is a string 'aba' that occurs twice. Your task is to output F(i) for every i so that 1<=i<=|S|.</div>
