<h1>BALL - The Ball</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>In a coordinate plane, there are N horizontal conveyor belts, each moving either leftwards or rightwards. When the ball falls on a belt, the belt drags it in direction it's moving. When the ball reaches the end of the belt, it falls vertically downwards. For example, if the belt is moving rightwards and it ends in the unit square with x-coordinate 12, the ball will fall from the belt on the x-coordinate 13, and continue falling on the same x-coordinate until it falls on another belt or reaches the ground (the height of 0).
Frane drops a ball many times (from the height that is greater than any of the belt heights), from various x-coordinates, and your task is: for each ball Frane drops, determine the direction of each belt such that this ball falls on as many belts as possible.
