<h1>CF25E - Test</h1>
<h2>题意翻译</h2>
<div>Bob出了一道字符串题，题目的输入是一个字符串。毒瘤的Bob写了3个程序，但他发现了一个悲剧：当输入的字符串有子串s1时，程序1会WA；当输入的字符串有子串s2时，程序2会死循环；当输入的字符串有子串s3时，程序3会MLE。当然，可以假定其他情况下程序不会出锅。Bob非常毒瘤，他想找一个最短的输入字符串ss，使得3个程序都过不了。请输出最小的长度。
输入格式：
多组数据，每组数据3行，每行一个字符串，分别代表s1,s2,s3，只含小写字母。
输出格式：
对于每组数据，输出一个整数代表最小长度，然后换行。
数据规模与约定：
对于100%的数据，1≤∣s1∣,∣s2∣,∣s3∣≤10^5。</div>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Sometimes it is hard to prepare tests for programming problems. Now Bob is preparing tests to new problem about strings — input data to his problem is one string. Bob has 3 wrong solutions to this problem. The first gives the wrong answer if the input data contains the substring _s_ $ _{1} $ , the second enters an infinite loop if the input data contains the substring _s_ $ _{2} $ , and the third requires too much memory if the input data contains the substring _s_ $ _{3} $ . Bob wants these solutions to fail single test. What is the minimal length of test, which couldn't be passed by all three Bob's solutions?</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>There are several test cases. For each test case there are exactly 3 lines. The _i_-th line contains string _s_ $ _{i} $ . All the strings are non-empty, consists of lowercase Latin letters, the length of each string doesn't exceed 10 $ ^{5} $ .</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case output one number — what is minimal length of the string, containing _s_ $ _{1} $ , _s_ $ _{2} $ and _s_ $ _{3} $ as substrings.</div>
