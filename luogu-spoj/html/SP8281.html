<h1>INTCOMB - Combination Of Integers</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>You will be given n positive integers a\_1, a\_2, ..., a\_n. We say that a nonnegative integer combination of these numbers is of the form a\_1\*b\_1 + a\_2\*b\_2 + ... + a\_n\*b\_n where each of b\_1, b\_2, ..., b\_n is a nonnegative integer. You are to determine how many positive integers cannot be expressed as a nonnegative integer combination of a\_1, a\_2, ..., a\_n.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>The first line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases (about 30). Each test case consists of a single line. The first integer on the line is n, between 1 and 30, which indicates the number of integers a\_1, a\_2, ..., a\_n. Then n integers follow each between 1 and 100,000. The i'th such integer is a\_i. All integers on this line are separated by a space.</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case you are to output a single line. If there are only a finite number of positive integers that cannot be expressed as a nonnegative integer combination of a\_1, a\_2, ..., a\_n, then you are to output this number. Otherwise, simply output the text "Infinite" (without quotes).</div>
<h2>输入输出样例</h2>
<h3>输入样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>\n3 \n2 2 4 \n2 4 5 \n3 11 12 13\n</code></pre>
<h3>输出样例 #1</h3>
<pre><code>Infinite \n6 \n30\nExplanation\nSample Test 2 :\nYou cannot express 1,2,3,6,7 and 11 using only the integers 4 and 5.\n\n</code></pre>
