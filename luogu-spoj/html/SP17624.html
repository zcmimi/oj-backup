<h1>GCOOP - Cooperation in geometry !</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Aang is fond of geometric figures, especially with equilateral triangles. He likes to know how well equilateral triangles cooperate with other figures.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>First line consists of t, the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 20)
Next t lines consists of 6 values t1, a, l, b, t2 and r denoting side of first triangle, side of square, length and breadth of rectangle, side of second triangle and radius of circle. (all values will lie between 1 and 100 inclusive)
**Output**
For each test case, print a single line consisting of the cooperation values of the first triangle with the square, rectangle, circle and the other triangle respectively. (separated by spaces rounded off to 4 decimal digits)
**Example**
```
Input:
1
2 2 2 3 2 1
Output:
7.4641 9.4641 7.4641 5.1962
