<h1>BAISED - Biased Standings</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Usually, results of competitions are based on the scores of participants. However, we are planning a change for the next year of IPSC. During the registration each team will be able to enter a single positive integer : their preferred place in the ranklist. We would take all these preferences into account, and at the end of the competition we will simply announce a ranklist that would please all of you.
But wait... How would that ranklist look like if it won't be possible to satisfy all the requests?
Suppose that we already have a ranklist. For each team, compute the distance between their preferred place and their place in the ranklist. The sum of these distances will be called the badness of this ranklist.</div>
