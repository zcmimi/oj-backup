<h1>MXSBMTRX - Largest Increasing Sub-Matrix</h1>
<h2>题目描述</h2>
<div>Mosa loves all sorts of properties of matrices. One day his coach Fegla asked him to draw a matrix with size N × M and insert random numbers in each cell, then he asked him to find the largest increasing sub-matrix.
It's defined as a matrix that each cell in the position (i, j) is greater than the cells in positions:
(i - 1, j), (i, j - 1) and (i - 1, j - 1).

Help Mosa to find the size of the largest increasing sub-matrix.</div>
<h2>输入输出格式</h2>
<h3>输入格式</h3>
<br />
<div>**t** - the number of test cases, then t test cases follows. \[**t** <= 50\]
Each test case contains two integers **N** and **M** indicating the matrix dimensions \[1 <= **N \*** **M** <= 10 $ ^{5} $ \].
Each of the next **N** lines contains **M** integers, separated by a space, describing the elements of the matrix.
Element **X** $ _{i,j} $ of the matrix is the jth integer of the ith line in the input \[-10 $ ^{9} $ <= **X** $ _{i,j} $ <= 10 $ ^{9} $ \].</div>
<h3>输出格式</h3>
<br />
<div>For each test case in the input your program must print on single line, containing the solution of the problem.</div>
