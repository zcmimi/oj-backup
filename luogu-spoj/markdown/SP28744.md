# KATHTHI2 - Coin Fight

## 题目描述

Problem Statement :

Sathish and Kathiresan are known for Coin Fight.

Kathiresan kept on tossing a biased coin repeatedly. Then he decided to solve the following problem.

Find the number of tosses for which the probability of getting exactly K heads is maximum. In case of a tie, return the minimum number of tosses.

In other words, find the minimum n such that Prob (exactly K heads with n tosses) >= Prob (exactly K heads with m tosses) for any m!=n.

**Input :**

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case you are given an integer K, the number of heads required and a float p, the probability to get a head when the coin is tossed.

**Output :**

For each test case find the number of tosses required as defined.

**Input Constraints :**

1 <= t <= 100

1 <= K <= 100

0.00 < p <= 1.00

p will always contain 2 decimal places

**Time Limit :**

3 seconds

**Sample Input :**

5 1.00

1 0.50

2 0.30

**Sample Output :**
