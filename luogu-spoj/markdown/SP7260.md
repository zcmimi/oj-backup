# NUMGAME - Number Game

## 题目描述

Arya and Bran are playing a game. Initially, two positive integers **A** and **B** are written on a blackboard. The players take turns, starting with Arya. On his or her turn, a player can replace **A** with **A** - **k**\***B** for any positive integer **k**, or replace **B** with **B** - **k**\***A** for any positive integer **k**. The first person to make one of the numbers drop to zero or below loses.

For example, if the numbers are initially (12, 51), the game might progress as follows:

- Arya replaces 51 with 51 - 3\*12 = 15, leaving (12, 15) on the blackboard.

- Bran replaces 15 with 15 - 1\*12 = 3, leaving (12, 3) on the blackboard.

- Arya replaces 12 with 12 - 3\*3 = 3, leaving (3, 3) on the blackboard.

- Bran replaces one 3 with 3 - 1\*3 = 0, and loses.

We will say (**A**, **B**) is a _winning_ position if Arya can always win a game that starts with (**A**,**B**) on the blackboard, no matter what Bran does.

Given four integers **A $ _{1} $** , **A $ _{2} $** , **B $ _{1} $** , **B $ _{2} $** , count how many winning positions (**A**, **B**) there are with **A $ _{1} $** A A $ _{2} $ and **B $ _{1} $** B B $ _{2} $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow, one per line. Each line contains the four integers **A $ _{1} $** , **A $ _{2} $** , **B $ _{1} $** , **B $ _{2} $** , separated by spaces.

1 T 1 A $ _{1} $ A $ _{2} $ 1 B $ _{1} $ B $ _{2} $ **A $ _{2} $** - **A $ _{1} $** **B $ _{2} $** - **B $ _{1} $**

### 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of winning positions (**A**, **B**) with **A $ _{1} $** A A $ _{2} $ and **B $ _{1} $** B B $ _{2} $ .
