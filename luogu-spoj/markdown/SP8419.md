# BTCODE_A - Traversing Grid

## 题目描述

Given 2 points in 2 dimensional space (xs,ys) and (xd,yd), your task is to find whether (xd,yd) can be reached from (xs,ys) by making a sequence of zero or more operations.

From a given point (x, y), the operations possible are:

a) Move to point (y, x)

b) Move to point (x, -y)

c) Move to point (x+y, y)

d) Move to point (2\*x, y)

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases. T lines follow, one for each test case. For each test case, the input contains one line denoting the 4 integers xs, ys, xd, yd

### 输出格式

Output T lines, one for each test case. For each test case, output "YES" if (xd,yd) is reachable from (xs,ys) and "NO" otherwise. (quotes for clarity)

## 输入输出样例

### 输入样例 #1

```cpp
1
1 1 2 2
```


### 输出样例 #1

```cpp
YES

Constraints:
T &amp;lt;= 25
-10^10 &amp;lt;= xs, ys, xd, yd &amp;lt;= 10^10
Note that, although the input values are constrained by the above inequality, the coordinates of the points
at the intermediate steps need not be.
