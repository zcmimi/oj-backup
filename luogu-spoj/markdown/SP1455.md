### 输入格式

A Program which has the following format:

```

::={}

::=

::= |  |  |  | 

::=+

::=?

::=GO

::=IF=

::=END

::=

::=

::={}

::=A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z

::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9

::=(ASCII 10)

::=(ASCII 32)

```

The program runs following the following rules:

- Program starts from the sentence whose level is minimum, and executed by the level from low to high except that the sentence isor.

- All variables are initialized to 0.

- means+=in C++.

- means write the value ofto the output file(we aren't interesting about the real output file.)

- means if and only if the value of the  equals to ,  will be executed, otherwise the next sentence executed is as usual.

- After, the next sentence executed is the sentence with level which equals to the level in.

- Program terminates by itself when  is executed.

- The numbers during the program is running will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

- The number of sentences in the program is not more than 100.

- The length of each line in the input file is not more than 20.

- The input is correct.

- The sentence with the maximum level is always .

- Any level is not more than 3000.

### 输出格式

Output the number of sentences executed.If the program can not terminate by itself,output -1.
