# INTEGMAX - Integral Maximization

## 题目描述

A set of points on the XY plane, all of them with different x coordinate, defines a polygonal

line in the following way: sort the points in increasing order of their x coordinates, and connect

each point with its neighbors. The integral of such polygonal line is the area contained below

the line and above the x axis, between the first and last values of x. For instance, the set of

points {(5, 1), (3, 2), (6, 2), (2, 1)} defines the polygonal line shown in the figure; the integral of

the polygonal line is the shaded area, with a value of 6.

Given a set of N different values for x, and a set of N values for y, we want to pair them to

form N points on the plane such that the integral of the polygonal line defined by the points is

as large as possible.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly three lines. The first line of

each test case contains an integer N indicating the number of points in the set (2 The second line contains N different integers Xi separated by single spaces (1 for 1 (Xi < Xi+1 for 1 (1 particular order. The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should not be processed

as a test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case output a single line with the maximum integral of a polygonal line formed

by pairing the input values, using exactly one decimal digit. Notice that one decimal digit is

always enough to represent the exact value of the integral of a polygonal line defined by points

with integer coordinates.
