# MMINPER - Minimum Permutation

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MMINPER/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MMINPER/vn/) ```

The inversion number of an integer sequence a1, a2, . . . , an is the number

of pairs (ai, aj) that satisfy i  aj . Given n and the inversion

number m, your task is to ﬁnd the smallest permutation of the set { 1, 2, . . . , n } ,

whose inversion number is exactly m. A permutation a1, a2, . . . , an is smaller

than b1, b2, . . . , bn if and only if there exists an integer k such that aj = bj

for 1 ≤ j < k but ak

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

```

The input consists of several test cases. Each line of the input contains two

integers n and m. Both of the integers at the last line of the input is −1,

which should not be processed. You may assume that

1 ≤ n ≤ 50000 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 1/2n(n − 1).

Sample Input

5 9

7 3

-1 -1

```

### 输出格式

```

For each test case, print a line containing the smallest permutation as

described above, separates the numbers by single spaces.

Sample output

4 5 3 2 1

1 2 3 4 7 6 5
