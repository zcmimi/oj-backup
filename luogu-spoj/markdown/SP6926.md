# CT23E - Tree game 

## 题目描述

Recently Bob invented a new game with a tree (we should remind you, that a tree is a connected graph without cycles): he deletes any (possibly, zero) amount of edges of the tree, and counts the product of sizes of the connected components left after the deletion. Your task is to find out the maximum number that Bob can get in his new game for a given tree.
