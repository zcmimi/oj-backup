# NSQUARE - NSquare Sum ( Easy )

## 题目描述

Given two integers N ( N <= 10^18 ) and a prime number P ( 1 < P < 10^18 ), find the lowest number x such that there're not N integers greater or equal to 0 whose sum of squares is equal to x.

N = 2, P = 2

x = 3mod2 = 1

0 = 0² + 0²

1 = 1² + 0²

2 = 1² + 1²

4 = 2² + 0²

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 There're two integers N ( 1 <= N <= 10^18 ) and a prime number P ( 1 < P < 10^18 ). You have to print the answer modulo P.

### 输出格式

 You have to print an integer x mod P ( -1 < x < 10^18 + 1 ) that satisfies the problem. If there's no number x, print "Impossible".
