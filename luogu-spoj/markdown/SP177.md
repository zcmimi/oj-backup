# ABWORDS - AB-words

## 题目描述

Every sequence of small letters a and b (also the empty sequence) is called an ab-word. If _X_ = \[_x_ $ _{1} $ , ..., _x_ _$ _{n} $_ \] is an ab-word and _i_, _j_ are integers such that 1 <= _i_ <= _j_ <= _n_ then _X_\[_i_.._j_\] denotes the subword of _X_ consisting of the letters _x_ _$ _{i} $_ , ..., _x_ _$ _{j} $_ . We say that an ab-word _X_ = \[_x_ $ _{1} $ .._x_ _$ _{n} $_ \] is nice if it has as many letters a as b and for all _i_ = 1, ..., _n_ the subword _X_\[1.._i_\] has at least as many letters a as b.

Now, we give the inductive definition of the similarity between nice ab-words.

- Every two empty ab-words (i.e. words with no letters) are similar

- Two non-empty nice ab-words _X_ = \[_x_ $ _{1} $ , ..., _x_ _$ _{n} $_ \] and _Y_ = \[_y_ $ _{1} $ , ..., _y_ _$ _{m} $_ \] are similar if they have the same length (_n_ = _m_) and one of the following conditions if fulfilled:

1. _x_ $ _{1} $ = _y_ $ _{1} $ , _x_ _$ _{n} $_ = _y_ _$ _{n} $_ and _X_\[2.._n_-1\] and _Y_\[2.._n_-1\] are similar ab-words and they are both nice;

2. there exists _i_, 1 <= _i_ <= _n_, such that _X_\[1.._i_\], _X_\[_i_+1.._n_\] are nice ab-words and

1. _Y_\[1.._i_\], _Y_\[_i_+1.._n_\] are nice ab-words and _X_\[1.._i_\] is similar to _Y_\[1.._i_\] and _X_\[_i_+1.._n_\] is similar to _Y_\[_i_+1.._n_\], or

2. _Y_\[1.._n_-i\], _Y_\[_n_-_i_+1.._n_\] are nice ab-words and _X_\[1.._i_\] is similar to _Y_\[_n_-_i_+1.._n_\] and _X_\[_i_+1.._n_\] is similar to _Y_\[1.._n_-_i_\].

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The number of test cases _t_ is in the first line of input, then _t_ test cases follow separated by an empty line.

In the first line of a test case there is a number _n_ of elements of the set _S_, 1 <= _n_ <= 1000; in the following _n_ lines there are elements of the set _S_, i.e. nice ab-words (one word in each line); the first letter of every ab-word is the first symbol in line and there are no spaces between two consecutive letters in the word; the length of every ab-word is an integer from the range \[1..200\].

### 输出格式

For each test case your program should output one line with one integer - the level of diversity of _S_.
