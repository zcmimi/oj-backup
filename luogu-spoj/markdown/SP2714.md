# COWCAR - Cow Cars

## 题意翻译

编号为1到N的N只奶牛正各自驾着车打算在牛德比亚的高速公路上飞驰．高速公路有M(1≤M≤N)条车道．奶牛i有一个自己的车速上限Si(l≤Si≤1,000,000)．

在经历过糟糕的驾驶事故之后，奶牛们变得十分小心，避免碰撞的发生．每条车道上，如果某一只奶牛i的前面有南只奶牛驾车行驶，那奶牛i的速度上限就会下降kD个单位，也就是说，她的速度不会超过Si – kD(O≤D≤5000)，当然如果这个数是负的，那她的速度将是0．牛德比亚的高速会路法规定，在高速公路上行驶的车辆时速不得低于/(1≤L≤1,000,000)．那么，请你计算有多少奶牛可以在高速公路上行驶呢？**~~P2909~~**

## 题目描述

N (1 ≤ N ≤ 50,000) cows conveniently numbered 1, ..., N are driving in separate cars along a highway in Cowtopia. Cow i can drive in any of M different high lanes (1 ≤ M ≤ N) and can travel at a maximum speed of S $ _{i} $ (1 ≤ S $ _{i} $ ≤ 1,000,000) km/hour.

After their other bad driving experience, the cows hate collisions and take extraordinary measures to avoid them. On this highway, cow i reduces its speed by D (0 ≤ D ≤ 5,000) km/hour for each cow in front of it on the highway (though never below 0 km/hour). Thus, if there are K cows in front of cow i, the cow will travel at a speed of max(S $ _{i} $ - D\*K, 0). While a cow might actually travel faster than a cow directly in front of it, the cows are spaced far enough apart so crashes will not occur once cows slow down as described.

Cowtopia has a minimum speed law which requires everyone on the highway to travel at a a minimum speed of L (1 ≤ L ≤ 1,000,000) km/hour, so sometimes some of the cows will be unable to take the highway if they follow the rules above. Write a program that will find the maximum number of cows that can drive on the highway while obeying the minimum speed limit law.
