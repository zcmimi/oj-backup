# UNICA - Unique Strings

## 题目描述

Some people who love strings have decided to call a special group of strings as the **“unique strings.”**

Let’s define **a(S)** as the number of characters “a” the string S contains, and **b(S)** as the number of characters “b” the string S contains.

S is a unique string if:

1\) S only contains the characters “a” and “b”

2\) For every substring S’of S, | a(S’) – b(S’) | <= 3

For example, “abbab” is a unique string. However, “abbbba” is not because it includes the substring “bbbb” for which | a(“bbbb”) – b(“bbbbb”) | = 4 > 3.

Let’s say we sort the unique strings – **first by length and then lexicographically**. The N $ ^{th} $ unique string is the string that appears in the position N in the sorted list. The first unique string is assigned the number 1.

The first 12 unique strings in the sorted list are: **a, b, aa, ab,ba, bb, aaa, aab, aba, abb, baa, bab**
