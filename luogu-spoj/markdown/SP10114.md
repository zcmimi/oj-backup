# RMTLAND - Remoteland

## 题目描述

In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their independence day every year. However, as it was a long long time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only thing people can remember is that today, the number of days elapsed since their independence (_D_) is a perfect square, and moreover it is the largest possible such number one can form as a product of distinct numbers less than or equal to _n_.

As the years in Remoteland have 1,000,000,007 days, their citizens just need _D_ modulo 1,000,000,007. Note that they are interested in the largest _D_, not in the largest _D_ modulo 1,000,000,007.

**Input**

Every test case is described by a single line with an integer _n_, (1 n

**Output**

For each test case, output the number of days ago the Republic became independent, modulo 1,000,000,007, one per line.
