# ZZPERM - Zig-Zag Permutation

## 题目描述

In the following we will deal with nonempty words consists only of lower case letters 'a','b',..., 'j' and we will use the natural 'a' < 'b' < ...  W(i+1) and W(j) < W(j+1) for all odd 0 < i < n and for all even 0 < j  W(i+1) and W(j) < W(j+1) for all even 0 < i < n and for all odd 0 < j < n. For example: "aabcc" is not zig-zag, "acacb" is zig-zag, "cac" is zig-zag, "abababc" is not zig-zag. If you imagine all possible zig-zag permutations of a word in increasing lexicographic order, you can assign a serial number (rank) to each one. For example: the word "aabcc" generates the sequence: 1  "acacb", 2  "acbca", 3  "bacac", 4  "bcaca", 5  "cabac", 6  "cacab".

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input file consists several test cases. Each case contains a word (W) not longer than 64 letters and one positive number (D). The letters of each word are in increasing order. Input terminated by EOF.

### 输出格式

For each case in the input file, the output file must contain all of the zig-zag permutations of W whose zig-zag serial is divisible by D, in increasing lexicographic order - one word per line. In the next line you have to print the total number of zig-zag permutations of W. There is no case that produces more than 365 lines of output. Print an empty line after each case.
