# RIGHTTRI - Right Triangle Counting 

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/RIGHTTRI/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/RIGHTTRI/vn/)N points are placed in the coordinate plane. Write a program which calculates in how many ways a right triangle can be formed by three of the given points. A right triangle is one in which one of the angles is 90 degrees.

``Input

=====

 ``The first line of input contains an integer N (3 <= N <= 1500), the number of points. Each of the following N lines contains the coordinates of one point, two integers separated by a space. The coordinates will be between -10^9 and 10^9. No two points will be located at the same coordinates.

 ```

```

Output

======

 `Output the number of right triangles. `
