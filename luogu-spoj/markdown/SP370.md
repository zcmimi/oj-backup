# ONEZERO - Ones and zeros

## 题目描述

Certain positive integers have their decimal representation consisting only of ones and zeros, and having at least one digit one, e.g. 101. If a positive integer does not have such a property, one can try to multiply it by some positive integer to find out whether the product has this property.
