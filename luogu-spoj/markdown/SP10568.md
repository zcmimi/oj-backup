# GRAPHCUT - Graph Cut

## 题目描述

Given a graph G, and a subset of its vertices X. The associated cut of X is the set of edges

associated to X is the subset of all edges in G such that exactly one of the two vertices it joins

belongs to X.

In thinks, you will be given a graph and a subset of its edges, and you will have to determine

whether there exists a subset of the vertices of the graph for which the given subset of the edges

is its associated cut.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases (1 a line which contains three integers N (2 vertices in the graph, and the number of edges in the subset for which we want to know whether

it is an associated cut or not. Then, E lines follow, each of them contains two integers u,v (1 N) which are the vertices joined by the edge, the first K of these E lines represent the asked subset.

### 输出格式

Output T lines, one for each test case. If the asked subset is an associated cut, then print “YES”,

otherwise print “NO”.
