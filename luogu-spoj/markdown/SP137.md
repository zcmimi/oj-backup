# PARTIT - Partition

## 题目描述

 A _partition_ of positive integer m into n components is any sequence a $ _{1} $ ,...,a $ _{n} $ of positive integers such that a $ _{1} $ +...+a $ _{n} $ =m and a $ _{1} $ <=a $ _{2} $ <=...<=a $ _{n} $ . Your task is to determine the partition, which occupies the k-th position in the lexicographic order of all partitions of m into n components.

The lexicographic order is defined as follows: sequence a $ _{1} $ ,...,a $ _{n} $ comes before b $ _{1} $ ,...,b $ _{n} $ iff there exists such an integer i,1<=i<=n, that a $ _{j} $ =b $ _{j} $ for all j, 1<= j< i, and a $ _{i} $ < b $ _{i} $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The input begins with the integer t, the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

For each test case the input consists of three lines, containing the positive integers m, n and k respectively (1<=n<= 10, 1<= m<=220, k is not larger than the number of partitions of m into n components).

### 输出格式

 For each test case output the ordered elements of the sought partition, separated by spaces.
