# MPOLSTAR - Star Polygon or Not

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MPOLSTAR/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MPOLSTAR/vn/) ```

After counting so many stars in the sky in his childhood, Isaac, now an astronomer

and a mathematician, uses a big astronomical telescope and lets his image

processing program count stars. The hardest part of the program is to judge

if a shining object in the sky is really a star. As a mathematician, the

only way he knows is to apply a mathematical definition of stars.

The mathematical definition of a star shape is as follows: A planar

shape F is star-shaped if and only if there is a point C in F such that,

for any point P in F, the line segment CP is contained in F. Such a point C

is called a center of F. To get accustomed to the definition, let's

see some examples below.

The first two are what you would normally call stars. According to the

above definition, however, all shapes in the first row are star-shaped.

The two in the second row are not. For each star shape, a center is indicated

with a dot. Note that a star shape in general has infinitely many

centers. For example, for the third quadrangular shape, all points in it

are centers.

Your job is to write a program that tells whether a given polygonal shape

is star-shaped or not.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

```

The input is a sequence of datasets followed by a line containing a single zero.

Each dataset specifies a polygon, and is formatted as follows.

n

x1 y1

x2 y2

....

xn yn

The first line is the number of vertices, n, which satisfies 4 <= n 

Subsequent n lines are the x- and y-coordinates of the n vertices.

They are integers and satisfy 0 <= xi <=10000 and 0 <= yi <= 10000

( i = 1,..., n).

Line segments (xi, yi)-(xi+1, yi+1) ( i = 1,..., n - 1) and the line segment

(xn, yn)-(x1, y1) form the border of the polygon in the counterclockwise order.

That is, these line segments see the inside of the polygon in the

left of their directions.

You may assume that the polygon is simple, that is, its border never

crosses or touches itself. You may also assume that no three edges of

the polygon meet at a single point even when they are infinitely extended.
