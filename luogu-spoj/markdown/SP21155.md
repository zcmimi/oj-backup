# MANJFIRE - Manoj and Fire

## 题目描述

Manoj is a geek who loves ciphering data. He is also known for doing stupid things like setting fire in his room like a caveman. One day he does that and accidentally throws a paper containing some sensitive information. However, he has the encrypted version of the data.

Each number in the original text is the number of pairs of integers **A**,**B (A<B, 1 <=A,B <=N)** such that their GCD Quotients match the given set of integers. GCD Quotients of a pair **(A,B)** is defined as the sequence of quotients that are obtained while computing the gcd of **A** and **B** **using Euclid's Algorithm**. For example,

 `          GCD(7,9) = `
