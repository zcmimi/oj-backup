# LEXBRAC - Bracket Sequence

## 题目描述

Correct Bracket Sequence (CBS) is a sequence that can be obtained through following rules:

1\) An empty string is the CBS.

2\) If A is a CBS, then B = (A) is also a CBS.

3\) If A is a CBS, then B = \[A\] is also a CBS.

4\) If A and B are CBS, then C = AB is also a CBS.

Length of the CBS is the number of brackets in it, and this number is always even.

Assume that '(' < ')' < '\[' < '\]'.

CBS a1a2 ... an is lexicografically smaller than the CBS b1b2 ... bn if and only if there exists an integer i, i <= n, so that aj=bj, for each j, 1 <= j < i and ai < bi.
