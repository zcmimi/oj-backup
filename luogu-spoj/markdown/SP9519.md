# DSUBMTR - Distinct Submatrices

## 题意翻译

给出一个仅包含大写字母的$n$行$m$列的字符矩阵，求其不同子矩阵的数目。对子矩阵相同的定义是：长，宽相同，且相同行列上字符全部相同的两个矩阵。

输入多组数据。对于每组数据按样例格式输出一行。

## 题目描述

Consider an matrix of capital letters. By selecting consecutive columns and rows, we can define the sub-matrix as the elements on chosen columns and rows.

Two sub-matrices should be regarded the same if and only if they have the same detentions and characters (which, of course, are capital letters) on corresponding position. It is your task to find the number of distinct sub-matrices of a given letter matrix.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains a lot of test cases. The first line of input contains exactly one integer, indicating the number of test cases.

For each of the test case, the first line contains two integers **N** and **M**, denoting the number of rows and columns of the given matrix. (1 <= **N**, **M** <= 128)

The next **N** lines contain only capital letters, indicating the given matrix.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct sub-matrices.
