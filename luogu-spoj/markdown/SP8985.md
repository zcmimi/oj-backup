# KOILINE - Line up

## 题目描述

N people are lined up in a straight line to enter a concert. Each person in this line knows how many people in front have shorter or same heights. Let's call the sequence representing these numbers S. So in other words, S\[i\] means that there are S\[i\] people in front of the ith person who have shorter or same heights than that of person i.

Given the heights of N people and a sequence S, determine the correct order of people lined up. (left is front)

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input is an integer N. (1<=N<=100,000)

The next N lines each consists of one integer H. (1<=H<=2\*10^9) These N integers are the heights of people lined up.

Then, sequence S is given in a single line, separated by a space.

### 输出格式

Determine the correct ordering of people lined up. Total of N lines should be output. The integer on the ith line represents the height of the ith person in the line.
