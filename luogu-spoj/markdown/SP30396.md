# GCDEASY - Easy GCD

## 题目描述

We call a sequence of n non-negative integers **A**, awesome if there exists some positive integers **x > 1** such that each element **Ai** in A (where **0 <= i < n**) is evenly divisible by **x**. Recall that **a** evenly divides **b** if there exists some integers **c** such that **b = a\*c**.

Given an awesome sequence, **A** and a positive integer **k**, find and print the maximum integer **L**, which satisfies the following conditions:

1. **0 <= L <= K**

2. A U {L} is also awesome. (**U** is union operator)

**Input:**

The first line contains the integer **t** denoting the number of test cases. The next line contains two space-separated positive integers, **n** (length of the sequence **A**) and **k** (the upper bound of answer **L**).

The third line contains **n** space separated positive integers describing the elements of **A**.

**Output:**

For each test case, Print the value of **L** in a single line (where **L** is the maximum integer  1**, there will always be an answer.

**Constraints:**

1 <= t <= 12

1 <= n <= 100000

1 <= k <= 1000000000

1 <= Ai <= 1000000000
