## 题目描述

[English](/problems/PA06ANT/en/) [Tiếng Việt](/problems/PA06ANT/vn/) A Byteotian ant is walking along the edges of ABCDEFGH cube:

If the ant goes through some edge **x** times, we count this edge **x** times. The ant would like to have interesting routes, that is if the ant is in some vertex, it would like to leave this vertex using an edge other than the edge recently used to enter this vertex (i.e. it want not to use the same edge twice in a row).

Our ant is not so smart, because it can only count using integers from 0 to **p-1**, for some **p**, so you should compute the result modulo **p**.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of the standard input contains two capital English letters **v $ _{1} $** and **v $ _{2} $** , separated by a single space. The two letters denote the starting and ending vertex of the ant's route respectively. The second line contains two integers **k** and **p**, separated by a single space.

### 输出格式

 Exactly one integer is to be written on the standard output. This integer is the number of interesting routes from the vertex **v $ _{1} $** to the vertex **v $ _{2} $** , containing exactly **k** edges, modulo **p**.
