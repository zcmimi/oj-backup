# MATRIX - Count maximum matrices

## 题目描述

You are given a matrix A of M rows and N columns, consisting of numbers 0 and 1. For a rectangle in A (sides >= 1), X1 is the number of ones on its sides, X0 is the number of zeros on its sides, and its _value_ is defined as X1 – X0. Let us consider W, the maximum value taken over submatrices of A, and S, the number of submatrices with value W. Your task is to find W and S.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains the number of testcases t (t <= 15). The first line of each testcase contains the numbers M, N (1 <= M, N <= 200) Then M lines follow. In each line, there are N numbers 0 or 1.

### 输出格式

For each testcase, you should output a single line with numbers W and S.
