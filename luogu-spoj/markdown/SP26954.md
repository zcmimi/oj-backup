# KALTSUM - k Alternating Sum

## 题目描述

Sameen has:

1. An array having N integers

2. Q friends

His friends are curious about the array. So, each of his friends asks Sameen a question about the array. Every question is described by 3 integers: i, j and k. In reply to a question, Sameen has to say the “k alternating sum” of the subarray starting at position i and ending at position j \[1 based indexing\]

“k alternating sum” of a subarray starting at position i and ending at position j can be calculated in the following way:

Add the first k numbers\[starting from position i\]

Subtract the second k numbers\[starting from position i+k\]

Add the third k numbers\[starting from position i+2\*k\]

Subtract the fourth k numbers\[starting from position i+3\*k\]

And so on till adding/subtracting the j-th number…

(j-i+1) will be divisible by k.

\[See sample Input/output and explanation section for more details\]

Can you help Sameen in answering the questions?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers N and Q. The next line contains N integers, the numbers in the array. Then each of the following Q lines contains 3 integers i, j & k.

### 输出格式

For each query output an integer in a separate line, the answer for that query. Queries should be answered in the order given in the input.

**Constraints:**

1 k 100000

1 N 100000

1 Q 100000

-1000000000 Value of a number in the array 1000000000

**(j-i+1) will be divisible by k.**
