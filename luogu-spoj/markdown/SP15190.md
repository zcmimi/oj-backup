# SBO - MAXIMUM RARITY

## 题目描述

Given a sequence of numbers, each number between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), find the contiguous subsequence with maximum rarity.

The rarity of a sequence is defined as the count of numbers which appear only once in that sequence. For example, let's consider the following sequence:

1 1 2 5 1 16 5

The rarity of the subsequence 1 1 2 5 is 2. This is because 2 and 5 are the only numbers which appear just once. 1 appears twice in the sequence, hence doesn't contribute to it's rarity. The rarity of subsequence 1 16 5 is 3 as each of the numbers appears only once. The maximum rarity achieved by any contiguous subsequence in the sequence 1 1 2 5 1 16 5 is 4. This is the rarity of 2 5 1 16.

Your task is to find the contiguous subsequence with maximum rarity and output that rarity value. You don't have to output the subsequence itself.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input will contain an integer N. N is the count of numbers in the input sequence.

1<=N<=500000.

The next line will contain the sequence of numbers. Each number in the sequence is an integer between 1 and 100000.

### 输出格式

The maximum rarity that any contiguous subsequence possesses.
