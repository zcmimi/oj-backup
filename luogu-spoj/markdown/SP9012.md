# MAXMATCH - Maximum Self-Matching

## 题目描述

You're given a string **s** consisting of letters 'a', 'b' and 'c'.

The matching function m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) is defined as the number of matching characters of **s** and its i-shift. In other words, m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) is the number of characters that are matched when you align the 0-th character of **s** with the i-th character of its copy.

You are asked to compute the maximum of m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) for all i ( 1 <= i <= |**s**| ). To make it a bit harder, you should also output all the optimal i's in increasing order.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first and only line of input contains the string **s**. 2 <= |**s**| <= 10 $ ^{5} $ .

### 输出格式

The first line of output contains the maximal m **$ _{s} $** ( i ) over all i.

The second line of output contains all the i's for which m $ _{s} $ ( i ) reaches maximum.
