# UNIHW - University Homework

## 题目描述

Hugo had quite a bad day today. His favourite university subject, mathematical analysis, was taught by his least liked substitute teacher - he always gave out an abnormaly large amount of homework. Today was no different.

The teacher wrote **N** numbers on the board, and after a long, thoughtful pause he told the class with a grin: "Well then, kids. For today's homework you will do this harmless exercise. As you can see, I've written quite a few numbers on the board, and your task is to find which smallest non-empty subset of them has the greatest product. That should keep you busy for today's evening!".

Sigh.

How could someone even come up with such a boring, time-consuming and impractical task. If only there was someone who would help Hugo and do it for him.
