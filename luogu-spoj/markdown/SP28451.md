# ADACITY - Ada and Cities

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug and her friends are on trip in Bugraine. Most of them are in different cities at the moment. They want to spread as much as possible, make hologram-skype to show all others the city. They have agreed, to make this call in time **T**.

The cities are connected with bi-directional roads. Each of the road has some length (which equals to time it takes to travel between two cities).
