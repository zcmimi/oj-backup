# LKS - Large Knapsack

## 题目描述

The **[knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem)** or **rucksack problem** is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

Just implement 0/1 Knapsack.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains two integers K and N, where K in the maximum knapsack size and N is the number of items. N lines follow where i $ ^{th} $ line describes i $ ^{th} $ item in the form v $ _{i} $ and w $ _{i} $ where v $ _{i} $ is the value and w $ _{i} $ is the weight of i $ ^{th} $ item.

### 输出格式

Output a single number - maximum value of knapsack. (All operations and the answer are guaranteed to fit in signed 32-bit integer.)
