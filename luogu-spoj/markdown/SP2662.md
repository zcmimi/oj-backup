# PUTIN - Put a Point in a Hyperspace

## 题目描述

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Multiple test cases, the number of them is given in the very first line.

For each test case:

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers K(2<=K<=30), S(2<=S<=10000), M(0<=M<=20). M lines follow, each contains K non-negative integers a $ _{ij} $ (1<=i<=M, 1<=j<=K), which shows that there is one point (a $ _{i1} $ , a $ _{i2} $ , ... a $ _{ik} $ ) in the K-D hyperspace. No two point will be the same, and none of them lies on any (coordinate) axis.

### 输出格式

For each test case:

Output a single integer which shows the number of the points B(b $ _{1} $ , b $ _{2} $ , ... b $ _{k} $ ) in the hyperspace satiesfied the following constraints:

- B is not on any (coordinate) axis.

- For each 1<= _i_ <= M, there exist _j_, 1<=j<=k, such that b $ _{j} $ < a $ _{ij} $ .

- For each 1<=j<=k, b $ _{j} $ is a non-negative integer.

- The sum of b $ _{j} $ doesn't exceed S.
