# STREET - Street

## 题目描述

There are **n** lots on one side of a street (where **n** k apartment buildings on these lots. Each building must occupy an interval of at most **t** consecutive lots. Moreover, each lot **i** has a height restriction **r\[i\]** (where **r\[i\]** i to **j** is:

**H = min{r\[i\], r\[i + 1\], ..., r\[j\]})**

Hence, the maximum usable facade space of the building is: **H × (j − i + 1)**. We would like to have a program to select at most **k** non-overlapping intervals to erect the buildings such that the total usable facade space is maximized.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input file is as follows: The first line contains three integers **n**, **k**, and **t** separated by a space character, where 1 n k t nlines contain **n** positive integers representing the height restriction for the **n** lots. For Example 1, the input file looks like:

```

10 2 4

7

3

12

11

13

4

8

6

6

20

```

The input should be read from the standard input, and your program will be run several times, each one with one of the test cases.

### 输出格式

The output file contains an integer which is the maximum usable facade space. For the above example, the output file looks like:

```

57

```
