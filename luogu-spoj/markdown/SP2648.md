# KPARCH - Archiver

## 题目描述

 One of your friends wants to write his own archiver. He is going to replace neighboring equal substrings with only one copy. For example, he is going to change substring "AA" with something like "2(A)" and if "A" is long enough it will reduce the file size.

But, before performing any coding stuff he wants to know how many such double substrings are there in the input file.

He asks you to help him, because this task is very difficult for him.

## 输入输出格式
