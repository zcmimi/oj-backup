# DCOWS - Dancing Cows

## 题目描述

It's the spring dance and, in a rare occurrence, the N (1 ≤ N ≤ 5000) bulls have been invited to dance with the M (N < M ≤ 5000) cows (as long as they stay on their very best behavior).

Farmer John, almost obsessive-compulsive in his organization of dances, wants the spectacle to be as visually attractive as possible. Thus, he wants to pair up the N bulls with cow partners such that the total of all the magnitudes of differences in height is minimized. Bulls have heights B\_i (1 ≤ B\_i ≤ 1,000,000) and cows have height C\_i (1 ≤ C\_i ≤ 1,000,000). Of course, some cows will be unmatched since N-M of them will have no partners; ignore their heights.

**INPUT FORMAT:**

\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M.

\* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: B\_i.

\* Lines N+2..M+N+1: Line i+N+1 contains a single integer: C\_i.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

\* Line 1: A single integer that is the minimum of the sum of the absolute value of the height differences that can be achieved.

**INPUT DETAILS:**

Five bulls + seven cows with various heights:

Bulls: 10 10 12 13 16

Cows: 6 7 9 10 11 12 17

```

**OUTPUT DETAILS :**

Here is one way to achieve a total difference of 4:

Bulls: 10 10 12 13 16

Cows: 6 7 9 10 11 12 17
