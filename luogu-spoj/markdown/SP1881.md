# ICODER - Instruction Decoder

## 题目描述

 Mathews uses a brand new 16-bit instruction processor. (Yeah i am being sarcastic!). It has one register (say R) and it supports two instructions:

- ADD X; Impact: R = (R + X) mod 65536

- MUL X; Impact: R = (R \* X) mod 65536

- \[For both instructions 0 <= X <= 65535\]

Mathews sees a segment of code, but doesnot know what value the register had before the code was being executed. How many possible values can the register have after the segment completed execution?

**Input Format:**

The input file consists of multiple testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains one integer, **N**. (1 <= N <= 100,000).

The following **N** lines contain one instructions each.

Input terminates with a line containing N=0, which must not be processed.

**Output Format:**

For each testcase print one integer in a single line, denoting the number of different values the register can take after code execution.

**Sample Input:**

```

1

ADD 3

1

MUL 0

5

MUL 3

ADD 4

ADD 3

MUL 2

8

ADD 32

MUL 5312

ADD 7

MUL 7

ADD 32

MUL 5312

ADD 7

**Sample Output:**

```

65536

1

32768

16

```
