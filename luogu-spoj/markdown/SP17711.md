# SPCJ - Gopu and Create Collections Part Two

## 题目描述

Little Gopu likes to play very much. As you know he only plays with numbers. So he is given n numbers. Now he tries to group the numbers into collections where each collection contains exactly two numbers. He can form the collection of two numbers a and b (a <= b), if and only if b is either 2 \* a or 2 \* a + 1.

Note that you can not use a single number in forming of more than one collections. Eg. 1, 2, 4 He can divide the numbers into a single collection only either \[1, 2\] or \[2, 4\] because each collection requires exactly two numbers, and each number has to be used only once in a group.

Given n numbers, Find out how many maximum number of collections he can form ?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

T: number of test cases.

For each test case, First line will contain n : (1 <= n <= 10^5)

Then next line will contain n numbers single space seperated. Range of each number will be between 1 and 10^18.

Sum of n over all the tests will be atmost 10^6. So number of test cases are decided on this criteria.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output maximum number of collections that can be formed.
