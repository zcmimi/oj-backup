# ENIGMATH - PLAY WITH MATH

## 题目描述

 You would have been fed up with competitive programming questions so far, now it is time to solve little math.

Assume you have a equation A \* x - B \* y = 0

For a given value of **A** and **B**, find the minimum positive integer value of **x** and **y** that satisfies this equation.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 First line contains **T**, number of test cases 0 <= **T** <=1000 followed by **T** lines.

First line of each test case contains two space seperated integers **A** and **B**. 1 <= **A**, **B** <=1 000 000 000.

### 输出格式

 For each test case, output a single line containing two integers **x** and **y** (seperated by a single space).
