# ADAGCD - Ada and GCD

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug got interesting homework. She had to count gcd of a few numbers. As she is a great mathematician, she done it in meanwhile (in fact, she submited it during the class it was assigned in). The teacher was impressed so he gave Ada a bonus homework (for bonus points). It is same as previous one with a little difference - there are bigger numbers.

Since the number are too large to be written as numbers, they are written as product of lesser numbers. Find their gcd.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input consists of **2 , the number of numbers for which Ada wants to find their gcd.**

Each of the next **N** lines contains an integer **1 followed by **M $ _{i} $** integers, **1 , the numbers whose product is the **i $ ^{th} $** number.****

The sum of all **M $ _{i} $** won't exceed **10 $ ^{6} $**

### 输出格式

Print the **gcd** on a single line. Since this number might be pretty big, output it modulo **10 $ ^{9} $ +7** (**1000000007**)
