# PMATRIX - Proving Equivalences

## 题意翻译

**题目大意**

给n个点,m条有向边(n<=2e4,m<=5e4),你需要在图中添加最少的有向边,使得原图成为一个强连通分量(任意两点可以互相到达).

**输入**

第一行一个整数T(T<=100),代表共有T组数据.

每组数据的首行有两个整数n,m.(意义见上),接下来的m行每行有两个整数u,v,表示从u到v有一条有向边.

**输出**

对每组数据,输出一行,仅有一个整数,代表你求得的需添加的有向边的数目.

**Hint**

## 题目描述

Consider the following exercise, found in a generic linear algebra textbook.Let A be an n × n matrix. Prove that the following statements are equivalent:

- (a) A is invertible.

- (b) Ax = b has exactly one solution for every n × 1 matrix b.

- (c) Ax = b is consistent for every n × 1 matrix b.

- (d) Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution x = 0.

The typical way to solve such an exercise is to show a series of implications. For instance,one can proceed by showing that (a) implies (b), that (b) implies (c), that (c) implies (d),and ﬁnally that (d) implies (a). These four implications show that the four statements are equivalent. Another way would be to show that (a) is equivalent to (b) (by proving that (a) implies (b) and that (b) implies (a)), that (b) is equivalent to (c), and that (c) is equivalent to (d).

However, this way requires proving six implications, which is clearly a lot more work than just proving four implications! I have been given some similar tasks, and have already started proving some implications. Now I wonder, how many more implications do I have to prove? Can you help me determine this ?
