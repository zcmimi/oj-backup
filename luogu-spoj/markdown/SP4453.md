# BOBALLS2 - Bouncing Balls II

## 题目描述

"Behold, my queen", said the jester, "the great Bouncing Ball Bowl!" The queen boredly waved her hand and sarcastically replied: "Let the fun begin!". And the fun begun! The jester spoke a magic word and all the colorful balls in his bowl started to roll and bounce, creating interesting pictures.

The queen watched vividly for a few minutes, but then she started to be bored again. "Just wait a moment, Your Majesty, in a minute they'll…" started the jester, but the queen interrupted: "I'm a queen! I don't want to wait! Can't you just fast forward it or something?"
