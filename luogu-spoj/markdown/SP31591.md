# ALLIN1 - All in One

## 题目描述

_Before you begin, you should try this problem! [AVL Tree](../SDITSAVL/)_

This problem is simple. Initially, there is a list and it's empty. Then you are given four types of query.

1. Insert data to the list

2. Remove data from the list

3. Print an index (1-based) from a specified data after the list was sorted ascendingly

4. Print data from a specified index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input contains several lines. Each line follows one of these formats.

**1 n**: Insert **n** (0 <= n <= 2 $ ^{31} $ - 1) to the list

**2 n**: Remove **n** from the list. If **n** was not found, do nothing

**3 n**: Print **n**'s index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly

**4 i**: Print data on **i**-th index (1-based) after the list was sorted ascendingly (0 <= i <= 2 $ ^{31} $ - 1)

**-1**: End of input

### 输出格式

For each query 3, print **n**'s index in one line. If **n** was not found, just print -1

For each query 4, print data on **i-**th index in one line. If the index is not valid, just print -1
