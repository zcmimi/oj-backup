# PAUL2 - A conjecture of Paul Erdős (hard)

## 题目描述

In number theory there is a very deep unsolved conjecture of the Hungarian Paul Erdős (1913-1996), that there exist infinitely many primes of the form _x_ $ ^{2} $ +1, where _x_ is an integer. However, a weaker form of this conjecture has been proved: there are infinitely many primes of the form _x_ $ ^{2} $ +_y_ $ ^{4} $ . You don't need to prove this, it is only your task to find the number of (positive) primes not larger than _n_ which are of the form _x_ $ ^{2} $ +_y_ $ ^{4} $ (where _x_ and _y_ are integers).
