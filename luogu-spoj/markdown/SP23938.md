# UJ01 - Save the Scofield !!

## 题目描述

Scofield is excellent at math tables, so T-BAG decided to make things a bit more interesting. He gives two numbers A and B and merges the tables of A and B in sorted order (ascending order), removing the duplicates and thus creates supertable of A and B and asks Scofield the Nth number in the supertable.
