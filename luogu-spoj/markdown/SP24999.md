# SMILEY1807 - 1807

## 题意翻译

有SmileyLand天使。女王的天使Smiley1807爱数字1807。她是如此痴迷于1807,她问她的程序员朋友编写一个程序,找到最大的子序列的长度有数字1,8 0、7。例如,如果给定的序列是1800777700088888000777然后最大的子序列满足上述条件之一是1800000000777(1888888000777)还有一个可能性,因此最大的子序列的长度是13。

## 题目描述

There is a SmileyLand of angels. The queen of all angels Smiley1807 loves the number 1807. She is so much obsessed with 1807 that she asked her programmer friend to write a program to find the length of the largest sub sequence having digits 1,8,0 and 7 in order. For example if given sequence is 1800777700088888000777 then one of the largest sub sequence satisfying the above condition is 1800000000777 (there is one more possibility of 1888888000777)and hence the length of largest sub sequence is 13.

## 输入输出格式
