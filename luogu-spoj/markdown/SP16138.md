# CODGRF - Deconnecting

## 题目描述

We define a Beta graph as a set of nodes connected by edges such that one node is connected to another node by at most one edge and no node has an edge starting and ending on itself. Each node has a finite number called 'degree' asssociated with it which is the number of edges connecting that node to the rest of the nodes.
