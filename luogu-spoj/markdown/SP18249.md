# IITWPC4F - Gopu and the Grid Problem

## 题目描述

```

Gopu is interested in the integer co-ordinates of the X-Y plane (0<=x,y<=100000). Each integer coordinate contain a lamp, initially all the lamps are in off mode. Flipping a lamp means switching it on if it is in off mode and vice versa. Maggu will ask gopu 3 type of queries.

 Type 1:  x l r,  meaning: flip all the lamps whose x-coordinate are between l and r (both inclusive) irrespective of the y coordinate.

 Type 2:  y l r, meaning: flip all the lamps whose y-coordinate are between l and r (both inclusive) irrespective of the x coordinate.

 Type 3: q x y X Y, meaning: count the number of lamps which are in ‘on mode’(say this number be A) and ‘off mode’ (say this number  be B) in the region where x-coordinate is between x and X(both inclusive) and y-coordinate is between y and Y(both inclusive).
