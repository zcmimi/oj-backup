# ACMAKER - ACM (ACronymMaker)

## 题意翻译

为ACM编程竞赛设计问题的虐待狂通常喜欢在问题描述中的某个地方包括缩写“ACM”。因此，在过去的几年里，世界总决赛的问题包括“公寓建设管理”，“文化和电影的雅典”，“封面制造商协会”，“ACM航空公司”，“计算机水生生物协会”，甚至还有一种昆虫，叫“Amelia Cheese Mite.”。然而，以A、C和M开头的有意义的单词组合的数量是有限的，并且问题作者开始没有想法（很难想到关于“反解构主义的Chthonian元语言学[Antidisestablishmentarianistic Chthonian Metalinguistics]”的问题）。幸运的是，现代文化在设计缩略语方面有更大的灵活性，例如：

```

GDB — Gnu DeBugger

LINUX — either “LINus’s UniX” or “LINUs’s miniX” or “Linux Is Not UniX”

SNOBOL — StriNg Oriented symBOlic Language

SPITBOL — SPeedy ImplemenTation of snoBOL

```

无关紧要的词（如“of”、“a”、“the”等）被忽略。

缩略语的字母必须以正确的顺序出现在要缩略的短语的重要单词中的字母的有序子列表中。

缩略语中的至少一个字母必须来自于每个重要单词（当然，一个字母的多次出现被认为是不同的）。

当然，这些规则在现实生活中经常被打破。例如，雷达(RADAR)是“RAdio Detecting And Ranging”的缩写。在我们的规则下（假定“and”是一个不重要的词），这将不是一个有效的缩写（然而，RADR或RADRAN或DODGING将是有效的）。你被要求列出一些无关紧要的单词和一些缩略语和短语，并根据上面的规则确定每个缩略语可以以多少方式由相应的短语构成。输入文件由多个场景组成。每个场景都以一个整数100>=n>=1开始，后面跟着n个无关紧要的单词，所有都是小写，每行一个，没有额外的空格。（包含0的行表示输入结束。）下面是这个场景的一个或多个测试用例，每行一个，后面跟着一行包含短语“LAST CASE”的行。包含测试用例的每一行都以一个缩写（仅大写字母）开始，后面跟着一个短语（仅小写字母和空格）。缩略语的长度至少为1，该短语包含至少一个有意义的词。没有输入行（包括缩写、短语和空格）将包含超过150个字符。然而，在这些范围内，缩略语和短语词可以是任意长度。

对于每个测试用例，输出以下的缩写：

`XXX is not a valid abbreviation`或`XXX can be formed in i ways`

其中，i是根据上述规则可以将缩略语的字母分配给短语中的字母的不同方式的数目。i的值不会超过32位带符号整数的范围。

## 题目描述

 The sadists who design problems for ACM programming contests often like to include the abbre- viation “ACM” somewhere in their problem descriptions. Thus, in years past, the World Finals has had problems involving “Apartment Construction Management,” the “Atheneum of Culture and Movies,” the “Association of Cover Manufacturers,” “ACM Airlines,” the “Association for Computa- tional Marinelife,” and even an insect named “Amelia Cheese Mite.” However, the number of word combinations beginning with A, C, and M that make sense is finite and the problem writers are starting to run out of ideas (it’s hard to think of problems about “Antidisestablishmentarianistic Chthonian Metalinguistics”). Fortunately, modern culture allows more flexibility in designing abbreviations — consider, for example:

```

GDB — Gnu DeBugger

LINUX — either “LINus’s UniX” or “LINUs’s miniX” or “Linux Is Not UniX”

SNOBOL — StriNg Oriented symBOlic Language

SPITBOL — SPeedy ImplemenTation of snoBOL

```

The rules used in these examples seem to be:

- Insignificant words (such as “of”, “a”, “the”, etc.) are ignored.

- The letters of the abbreviation must appear, in the correct order, as an ordered sublist of the letters in the significant words of the phrase to be abbreviated.

- At least one letter of the abbreviation must come from every significant word (multiple occurrences of a letter are, of course, treated as distinct).

Of course these rules are often broken in real life. For instance, RADAR is an abbreviation for “RAdio Detecting And Ranging”. Under our rules (assuming that “and” is an insignificant word), this would not be a valid abbreviation (however, RADR or RADRAN or DODGING would be valid). You have been asked to take a list of insignificant words and a list of abbreviations and phrases and to determine in how many ways each abbreviation can be formed from the corresponding phrase according to the rules above.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The input file consists of multiple scenarios. Each scenario begins with an integer 100 >= _n_ >= 1 followed by _n_ insignificant words, all in lower case, one per line with no extra white space. (A line containing 0 indicates end of input.) Following this are one or more test cases for this scenario, one per line, followed by a line containing the phrase “LAST CASE”. Each line containing a test case begins with an abbreviation (uppercase letters only) followed by a phrase (lowercase letters and spaces only). The abbreviation has length at least 1 and the phrase contains at least one significant word. No input line (including abbreviation, phrase, and spaces) will contain more than 150 characters. Within these limits, however, abbreviations and phrase words may be any length.

### 输出格式

 For each test case, output the abbreviation followed by either

is not a valid abbreviation

or

can be formed in i ways

where _i_ is the number of different ways in which the letters of the abbreviation may be assigned to the letters in the phrase according to the rules above. The value of _i_ will not exceed the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
