# BRCKTS - Brackets

## 题意翻译

给你几个开括号“(”和闭括号“）”，以及几个操作，包含下面两种操作：

·将第$i$ 个括号改为相反的括号。

·检查当前是否是正确的括号表达式。

## 题目描述

 We will call a **bracket word** any word constructed out of two sorts of characters: the opening bracket "(" and the closing bracket ")". Among these words we will distinguish **correct bracket expressions**. These are such bracket words in which the brackets can be matched into pairs such that

- every pair consists of an opening bracket and a closing bracket appearing further in the bracket word

- for every pair the part of the word between the brackets of this pair has equal number of opening and closing brackets

On a bracket word one can do the following operations: - **replacement** -- changes the i-th bracket into the opposite one

- **check** -- if the word is a correct bracket expression

### Task

Write a program which

- reads (from standard input) the bracket word and the sequence of operations performed,

- for every check operation determines if the current bracket word is a correct bracket expression,

- writes out the outcome (to standard output).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 Ten test cases (given one under another, you have to process all!). Each of the test cases is a series of lines. The first line of a test consists of a single number _n (1<=n0_ denotes replacement of _k_-th bracket by the opposite.

### 输出格式

 For every test case your program should print a line:

Test i:

where i is replaced by the number of the test and in the following lines, for every check operation in the i-th test your program should print a line with the word YES, if the current bracket word is a correct bracket expression, and a line with a word NO otherwise. (There should be as many lines as check operations in the test.)
