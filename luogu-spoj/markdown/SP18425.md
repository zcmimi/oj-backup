# POLYMUL - Polynomial Multiplication

## 题目描述

Sam and Dean fight the supernatural creatures to protect the humans. Now they have come across a creature called the Vedala, which are always found in pairs. Each vedala can be represented by a polynomial. Both the Vedalas need to be killed at once or else they can't be killed. They can be killed only by using the product of the two polynomials representing the two Vedala. Help Sam and Dean find the product of the polynomials fast, so they can do thier work.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains an integer **T (, number of test cases.**

Each test case will have **n (n , maximum degree of the polynomials on the first line.**

Next two lines will have n+1 space separated integers each representing the coeffiecients of first and second polynomials respectively.

All input coefficients values are **<=1000**.

### 输出格式

For each test case ouput a line of 2n space seperated integers indicating coefficients of the polynomial created after multiplication.
