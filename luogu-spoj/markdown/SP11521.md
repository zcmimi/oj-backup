# DOMINST - Dominant Strings

## 题目描述

**Dominant Strings**

Given two strings _s $ _{1} $_ and _s $ _{2} $_ , we say that _s $ _{1} $_ _dominates_ _s $ _{2} $_ if the (multi)set of characters in _s $ _{1} $_ is a proper superset of the (multi)set of characters in _s $ _{2} $_ . For instance, "acmicpc" dominates "camp", but it does not dominate "chimp" or "macpac". For a set _S_ of strings, we call the strings in _S_ which are not dominated by any string in _S_ the_dominant strings_ of _S_ (even if they do not dominate any strings in _S_).

Now, your task is simply to find all the dominant strings of a set of strings.
