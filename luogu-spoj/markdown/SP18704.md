# TRITILE - Triangle Tiling

## 题目描述

**Problem Statement**

Var is trying to find a new geometric shape with an even number of sides. She starts with an equilateral triangle and performs a series of n steps. At each step she adds an equilateral triangle to the outer sides of the shape she already has. Can you tell, if after n steps, her new shape will have even number of sides or not?

**Input**

First line contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n, denoting the total number of steps she performs.

**Output**

Print “Yes” if she ends up with a shape that has even number of sides, or print “No”.

**Constraints**

1 <= T <= 100

1 <= n <= 10 ^ 18

**Sample Input**
