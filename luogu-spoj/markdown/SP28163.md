## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. First line denotes the size of array, N and second line contains N integers forming the array.

1 2 0

### 输出格式

For each test case, print the answer as an irreducible fraction. Follow the format of the sample output.

The fraction p/q (p and q are integers, and both p >= 0 and q > 0 holds) is called irreducible, if there is no such integer d > 1 that divides both p and q separately.
