# PUCMMT02 - Square-Free Product (Hard)

## 题目描述

Integer X is Square-Free if and only if p2 (p is prime) does not divide it. For example, 15 is a square-free number but 12 isn't, because 22 = 4 is one of its divisors.

Write a program that outputs whether the product of two numbers is a square-free number.

Input

The first line contains T (1 a and b (1 18). a and b are NOT necessarily square-free.

Output

Per test case:

- Output a single line containing "YES" if the product of a and b is square-free, or "NO" otherwise. In any case, do not include quotes in your output.
