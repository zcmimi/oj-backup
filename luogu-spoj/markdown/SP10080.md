# LAWNMWR - Lawn Mower

## 题目描述

The International Collegiate Soccer Competition (ICSC) is famous for its well-kept rectangular stadiums. The grass playing fields in ICSC stadiums are always 100 meters long, and 75 meters wide. The grass is mowed every week with special lawn mowers, always using the same strategy: first, they make a series of passes along the length of the field, and then they do the same along the width of the field. All passes are straight lines, parallel to the sides of the field.
