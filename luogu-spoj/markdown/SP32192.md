The answer is 24.

**Input**

The first line of input will contain the test case **T (1 <= T <= 10)**.There will be two lines for each test case. First line will contain the value of **n(1<=n<=1000)** and the next line will contain the array elements space sperated intergers. Each integer will be between 1 and 1000000000.

**Output**

For each case of input, output the answer of the problem in the format "**Case X: Y**" where **X** denotes the number of test case and **Y** denotes the answer. Answer could be very large so output the answer modulo **100000007**.
