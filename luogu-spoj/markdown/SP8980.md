# KOICOST - Cost

## 题目描述

You are given an undirected graph with N verticies and M edges, where the weights are unique.

There is a function Cost(u, v), which is defined as follows:

While there is a path between vertex u and v, delete the edge with the smallest weight. Cost(u,v) is the sum of the weights of the edges that were deleted in this process.

![graph](../../content/francky:cost-graph "graph")

For example, from the graph above (same as the sample input), Cost(2,6) is 2+3+4+5+6 = 20.

Given an undirected graph, your task is to calculate the sum of Cost(u,v) for all vertices u and v, where u < v. Since the answer can get large, output the answer modulo 10^9.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input consists of two integers, N and M. (1 <= N <= 100,000, 0 <= M <= 100,000)

The next M lines consists of three integers, u, v, and w. This means that there is an edge between vertex u and v with weight w. (1 <= u, v <= N, 1 <= w <= 100,000)

### 输出格式

Output the sum specified in the problem statement.
