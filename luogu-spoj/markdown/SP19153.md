# INS14L - Rooted Trees

## 题目描述

Digo is given a rooted tree where nodes are numbered from 1 to N (1 is the root node) and asked some queries on it.

There are two types of queries

1) Given node number U, two integers X, K which means add X to the given node , X+K to its children , X+2\*K to children of its children and so on..

2) Given a node number U print the sum of nodes in the subtree rooted at U (including node U).

Since the answer can be too long, print the answer 10^9 + 7

Initially each node contains zero.

Input Format:

First line contains a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.

Next N-1 lines denotes the parent node of nodes 2 to N. (1 is the root node it has no parent)

Next line contains M (Number of queries).

In each of the next M lines first integer is T which means the type of the query.

If T is ,1 it is followed by three integers U, X, K as explained in the question.

If T is 2, it is followed by a single integer U.

Output Format:-

For each query of type 2, output a single line containing the required answer.

Constraints:-

1 <= N <= 100000

1 <= M <= 100000

1 <= X , K <=1000000000
