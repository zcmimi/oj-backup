# SVAREA11 - Save Area 11

## 题目描述

In the year 2010 of the Imperial Calendar, the Holy Britannian Empire invaded Japan and overpowered the defending forces. Japan became a dominion of the Empire. The country was stripped off her freedom, her rights and her name. The defeated and once proud nation was given a mere number as a name - Area 11.

After many years, Lelouch vi Britannia, the leader of the Black Knights, is making plans for some important battles against the Holy Britannian Empire army in his quest to free Area 11. He is assigning soldiers of the Black Knights to various strategically advantageous positions on the battlefields.

Lelouch assigns a soldier to a position from T $ _{1} $ second to T $ _{2} $ second. The soldier leaves to fight at the beginning of T $ _{1} $ second and returns at the end of T $ _{2} $ second. During this time, this soldier is unavailable for any other assignments. After returning, he is available for future assignments. A complete plan includes several of these assignments.

The Black Knights does not have unlimited number of soldiers. Lelouch has made plans for several battles and now he is trying to distribute his soldiers to carry out these plans. He takes a plan and allocates **N** soldiers for it. Then he asks you to check if the plan can be carried out successfully with N soldiers.

Help Lelouch make the plans. The fate of Area 11 depends on you!
