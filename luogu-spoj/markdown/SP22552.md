# PRJAN15E - Flow on Tree

## 题目描述

Mr. Kaboom has recently learned about maximum flow. Now his friend Mr. Taboom gave him this problem.

You are given a tree with **N** vertices. The vertices are numbered from **1 to N**. Each edge of the tree has some capacity associated with it. Between each pair of vertices there is only one way to go. Now imagine for each pair of vertices that one of the vertex is the source and the other is the sink. Then Mr. Kaboom needs to find out what is the maximum flow for each pair of vertices. Mr. Taboom decides to reduce Mr. Kaboom's misery and asked him to provide the sum of maximum flow between all possible pair of vertices. Mr. Kaboom has found no solution and has trusted you with this task. Can you save his day?
