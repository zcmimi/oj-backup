## 题目描述

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of:

- One line containing **C**, the number of test cases.

Then for each test case:

- One line containing **R**, the number of rectangles of cells that initially contain bacteria.

- **R** lines containing four space-separated integers **X** $ _{1} $ **Y** $ _{1} $ **X** $ _{2} $ **Y** $ _{2} $ . This indicates that all the cells with X coordinate between X $ _{1} $ and X $ _{2} $ , inclusive, and Y coordinate between Y $ _{1} $ and Y $ _{2} $ , inclusive, contain bacteria.

The rectangles may overlap.

North is in the direction of decreasing Y coordinate.

West is in the direction of decreasing X coordinate.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #N: T", where N is the case number (starting from 1), and T is the number of seconds until the bacteria all die.
