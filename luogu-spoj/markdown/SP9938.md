## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer **T** (1 ≤ **T** ≤ 25), indicating the number of test cases.

Each test case contains several lines. The first line contains three integers **N**, **M**, **K** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 50, 0 ≤ **M** ≤ **N**(**N**-1)/2, 0 ≤ **K** ≤ 8), indicating the number of locations(starting with 1, and 1 is the only gate of the park where the trip must be started and ended), the number of roads and the number of interested attractions.

The following **M** lines each contains three integers **A**, **B**, **D** (1 ≤ **A**, **B** ≤ **N**, 0 ≤ **D** ≤ 10 $ ^{4} $ ) which means it takes **D** minutes to travel between location **A** and location **B**.

The following **K** lines each contains several integers **P** $ _{i} $ , **T** $ _{i} $ , **FT** $ _{i} $ , **N** $ _{i} $ , **F** $ _{i,1} $ , **F** $ _{i,2} $ ... **F** $ _{i,Ni} $ -1, **F** $ _{i,Ni} $ , (1 ≤ **P** $ _{i} $ , **N** $ _{i} $ , **F** $ _{i,j} $ ≤ **N**, 0 ≤ **FT** $ _{i} $ ≤ **T** $ _{i} $ ≤ 10 $ ^{4} $ ), which means the i-th interested attraction is placed at location **P** $ _{i} $ and there are **N** $ _{i} $ locations **F** $ _{i,1} $ , **F** $ _{i,2} $ ... **F** $ _{i,Ni} $ where you can get the FastPass for the _i_-th attraction. If you come to the _i_-th attraction with its FastPass, you need to wait for only **FT** $ _{i} $ minutes, otherwise you need to wait for **T** $ _{i} $ minutes.

You can assume that all the locations are connected and there is at most one road between any two locations. Note that there might be several attractions at one location.

### 输出格式

For each test case in the input, print one line: "Case #X: Y", where **X** is the test case number (starting with 1) and **Y** is the minimum time of the trip.
