# ENUMRTNL - Enumeration of rationals

## 题目描述

It is well known that rational numbers form a countable set. Hence the set of rational numbers in the open interval (0,1) also form a countable set.

Here we enumerate the rationals in (0,1) in the following fashion. First, every rational is expressed in the lowest terms : ie, as p/q where p and q are positive integers with no common factor other than one. Then we sort the fractions in the ascending order of p+q. In case of a tie, the smaller fraction comes first.

The first few terms in this enumeration are 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 1/5, 1/6, 2/5...

Given a natural number N, find the numerator and denominator of the Nth term in the enumeration.
