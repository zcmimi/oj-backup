# ATOMS - Atoms in the Lab

## 题目描述

 Mr. Yagami is a scientist in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre. They are conducting a lab experiment on nuclear fission. In nuclear fission, one atom breaks into more than one atom of the same type.

Initially, there are **N** atoms in the lab. Starting from now **(t=0)**, after each second, every atom will break into **K** atoms of the same type. They don’t want the number of atoms to exceed **M**, so they have to stop the reaction at some time **t=T**. Can you find this value **T** for Mr. Yagami.
