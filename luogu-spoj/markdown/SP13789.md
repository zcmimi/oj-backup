# LOVINGPW - Loving Power

## 题目描述

Angel Luis is now getting math class. His teacher is teaching to him the XOR operation.

0 XOR 0 = 0

0 XOR 1 = 1

1 XOR 0 = 1

1 XOR 1 = 0

When is a number with more than a bit it operation is made to all bits. The teacher write two number x,y (0<=x<=N and 0<=y=0.

See that for N = 3 :

0 XOR 1 = 2 $ ^{0} $

0 XOR 2 = 2 $ ^{1} $

3 XOR 1 = 2 $ ^{1} $

2 XOR 3 = 2 $ ^{0} $

So there is 4 pairs.

Given N you should return how many pair module 1000000007.
