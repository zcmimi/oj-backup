# SNGNM2 - Number Magic II

## 题目描述

num (> 9) be a positive integer. sum is defined as sum\_of\_digits\_of\_num. avg is defined as

sum / digits\_in\_num and avg takes only integer values (for example 34 / 5 is equal to 6, i.e. integer part of 6.8). Now digits of num are rearranged by taking avg as pivoting element. Rearrangement is done according the following method -

**\[step 1\]**

**new\_num = avg;

read digits of num

if (digit > avg)

place digit at rightmost place in new\_num** else

**place digit at leftmost place in new\_num**

**\[step 2\]**

new\_num is again rearranged into two numbers, eve\_number (**formed by taking digits of new\_num at places 2, 4, 6, ...**) and odd\_number (**formed by taking digits of new\_num at places 1, 3, 5, ...**).

Remember that counting of digit place starts from leftmost digits as 1, 2, 3, 4...

\[step 3\]

**if (eve\_number has < 3 digits)

store the number

else

calculate avg and again start from process 1**

**if (odd\_number has < 3 digits)

store the number

else

calculate avg and again start from step 1**

Finally all desired numbers are stored and now we have to find two magical coefficients of num, named as alpha and beta.

\[method digit\_sum\]

**number = num**

**do {

number = sum of digits of number** } while (number >= 10)

**dig\_**sum $ _{&nbsp;} $ = number

\[alpha\]

**digit\_sum(summation\_of\_stored\_numbers)**

**\[beta\]

**digit\_sum(summation\_of\_digit\_sum(stored\_numbers))****

we will say num is magic number if alpha, beta and |aplha - beta| are digits of num.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input is t (< 101), total number of test cases. Each test case has n (< 501) as its first input and next n lines contains num (< 10 $ ^{101} $ ).

### 输出格式

For each test case, write exactly n lines containing value of alpha and beta; and yes or no according to whether or not num is magic number.
