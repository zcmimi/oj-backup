# MINMOVE - Minimum Rotations

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/MINMOVE/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MINMOVE/vn/)Given a string S\[1..n\] . A rotation on S is that we move the first character to the right-most of the string. More specific, after a rotation, S becomes T = S\[2..n\] + S\[1\].

For example: S = abcaa, then after a rotation we have S = bcaaa.

Find the minimum number of rotations to make S become the smallest lexicographical order string.
