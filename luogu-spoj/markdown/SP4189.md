# LANDING - Landing

## 题意翻译

给定平面内 $n$ 个整点,要求选出三个点做一个外接圆使得这个圆的半径最大且圆的内部(不包含边界)不存在其他点。输出最大的圆的半径。($n\leq10^5$，$|x|,|y|\leq 10^4$)

你可以假定至少存在一组解。

## 题目描述

Keep watching the skies! Alien spacecraft are due to land any day now to share all of their advanced programming secrets with us.

In preparation for this day, you've been asked with preparing a landing pad for our visitors in a given field. Unfortunately, due to enviromental considerations, you will not be permitted to remove any of the trees which currently exist on the field. These trees are of immense scientific research, since they have zero radius and only grow at points with integer co-ordinates. However, this could be a blessing in disguise. For security reasons, the landing pad must be in contact with atleast three trees. Security cameras will be placed at the tops of these trees.

Alien spacecraft are perfectly circular craft of various sizes, so the landing pad will also be circular. Since it would be polite to warn potential visitors ahead of time if their spacecraft is too large for our landing pad, you must now determine the size of largest circular region that we can place on the field which contacts at least three trees, but does not contain any trees within.
