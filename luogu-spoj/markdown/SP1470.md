# SEQ2 - Another Sequence Problem

## 题目描述

You are to write a program to perform some operations on a given sequence.These operations are listed below:

```

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Name | Input format | function |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Modify | MAKE-SAME i t c| Modify all the t numbers from the ith number(included) to |

| | | number c. |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Insert | INSERT i t s | Insert t numbers after the ith number.s is a sequence of t |

| | | numbers which should be inserted one-to-one.If i=0,you |

| | | should insert s in the first of the sequence. |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Delete | DELETE i t | Delete t numbers after the ith number(included). |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Reverse | REVERSE i t | Reverse t numbers after the ith number(included). |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Get sum | GET-SUM i t | Output the sum of t numbers after the ith number(included).|

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Get maximum | MAX-SUM | Output the maximum partial sum in the sequence now. |

| partial sum | | |

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```

See the example.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The very first line contains a single integer T(T<=4), the number of test cases.T blocks follow.

For each test case:

The first line contains two integers n and m(m<=20000), the number of numbers in the sequence in the beginning and the number of operations.

The second line contains n integers seperated by spaces, the sequence in the beginning.

Next m lines, each contains an operation listed above.

You can assume that for each test case:

- No invalid operation is in the input.

- Number of numbers in the sequence is no more than 500000 and not less than 1 at any time.

- All the numbers in the sequence is in range\[-1000,1000\] at any time.

- The total number of numbers inserted will be not more than 4,000,000.The input is no more than 20MB.

### 输出格式

For each Get sum and Get maximum partial sum operation,you should write the answer to the output,one per line.
