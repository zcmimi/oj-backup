# IITKWPCL - Find Distances In A Plane

## 题目描述

 Feluda loves reading city maps a lot. Now he has got a map of a city where each house is denoted with its x and y coordinate. As he is interested in estimating how good is arrangement of city, Should he would ask you these two questions.

1. What is minimum distance between any two houses ?

2. What is maximum distance between any two houses ?

Now given n points in a plane, You have to answer these two questions? As Feluda is scared by precision of decimal number representation in computers, you should tell Feluda the square of these distances.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line will contain n : no of houses. (n >= 2 && n <= 10^5)

Then next n lines where each line will contain x and y coordinate of house seperated by a single space. (-10^9 <= x , y <= 10^9).

### 输出格式

Output one line containing squares of minimum and maximum distance respectively seperated by single space.
