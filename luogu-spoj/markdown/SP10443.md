# BRDGS - Bridges

## 题意翻译

用桥梁连接每一块土地，桥梁的成本就是它的宽度。

T<200为测试数据数量。N <= 500为河流的数量。N行之后分别是5个整数，Di1, Fi1, Di2, Fi2和Wi <= 1000000，是第i条河流的极值坐标和宽度。每一个D在-90和90之间，每一个F在0和359之间，它们是用度数测量的，对应于球坐标(纬度和经度)。

从上面看，一条河的长为无穷，一条河的河道总是最小的，两条河的交点最多在一点。

对于每个测试用例，打印一行带有“case #X: C”的代码，其中X是测试用例的数量(从1开始)，C是构建桥梁的最低成本。

## 题目描述

A new planet full of rivers was discovered and is being prepared for colonization. We want to connect every piece of land by bridges, the cost of building a bridge is its width.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first number in the input file is T < 200, the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a line with a integer, N <= 500, the number of rivers. N lines are followed with 5 integers each, Di1, Fi1, Di2, Fi2 and Wi <= 1000000, the coordinates of the extremities and the width of the i-th river. Every D is between -90 and 90, and every F is between 0 and 359, they are measured in degrees and correspond to the spherical coordinates (latitude and longitude respectively).

The two extremities of a river can be seen from above in a distance less than infinite, a course of a river is always the smallest possible and two rivers intersect in at most 1 point.

### 输出格式

For each test case print a single line with "Case #X: C" where X is the number of the test case (starting from 1) and C is the minimum cost to build the bridges so the islands and continents are connected directly or indirectly to each other.
