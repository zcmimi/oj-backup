# MINSEQ - Minimal Possible String

## 题目描述

Given two strings A and B, your are to find the lexicographically smallest string after inserting B into A.

For example, string A is "369", and string B is "4799". There are 4 ways that I can insert B into A, and I’ll get 4 different results: 4799369, 3479969, 3647999, 3694799. Thus, 3479969 is the lexicographically smallest one.

## 输入输出格式
