# ANGRMTST - Lets Be An Anagrammatist

## 题目描述

Do you know what is an anagram? _**An anagram is a rearrangement of letters of one word to form another word.**_ For example: one of the anagram of the word “CODEMASK” can be “DEMOCSAK”. So, we can find different kinds of anagram of a word.

Now, you are given two array S & T. You have to find a **lexicographically smallest** contiguous subsequence of S which is an anagram of array T.

Between two sequence A & B, where length(A) == length(B), A will be lexicographically smaller than B if we can find an index i (1<= i <= length(A)) where A\[i\] < B\[i\] and for all j, A\[j\] = B\[j\] where 1 <= j < i.

**Input:**

The first line of the input is the number of the test cases Ts.

Each test case contains three lines. The first lines contains N & M, N is the length of array S & M is the length of array T.

Next line contains N integers of array S. Then another lines follows contains M integers describing array T.

**Constraints:**

1 <= Ts <= 20

1 <= N,M <= 200000

1 <= S\[i\], T\[i\] <= 200000

**Output:**

First you need to print the case number. Then on the same line, you have to print the index (1 based) of the lexicographically smallest contiguous subsequence of S which is an anagram of T. If there is more than one answer, you need to print the smallest index. If you can't find any anagram of the T in S, just print 0.

**Sample Input:**

`24 31 3 2 41 2 35 33 2 1 4 101 2 4`**Sample Output:**

 ```

Case 1: 1

Case 2: 2

```
