# DISQUERY - Distance Query

## 题意翻译

给有n个节点的树, 树上边有边权. 再给定q组询问, 每次询问两个点路径上的最小值和最大值.

本题中的n（节点个数）和K（询问个数）范围都是1~100000

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/DISQUERY/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/DISQUERY/vn/)The traffic network in a country consists of N cities (labeled with integers from 1 to N) and N-1 roads connecting the cities. There is a unique path between each pair of different cities, and we know the exact length of each road.

Write a program that will, for each of the K given pairs of cities, find the length of the shortest and the length of the longest road on the path between the two cities.

### Input

The first line of input contains an integer N, 2

The length of each road will be a positive integer less than or equal to 1 000 000.

The next line contains an integer K, 1

### Output

Each of the K lines of output should contain two integers – the lengths from the task description for the corresponding pair of the cities.
