## 题目描述

Mr. B loves to play with colorful stones. There are n colors of stones in his collection. Two stones with the same color are indistinguishable. Mr. B would like to select some stones and arrange them in line to form a beautiful pattern. After several arrangements he finds that it's very hard for him to enumerate all the patterns. So he asks you to write a program to count the number of different patterns.

Two patterns are considered different, if and only if they have different number of stones or have different colors on at least one position.
