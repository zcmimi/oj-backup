# PSYCHO2 - Psycho Function

## 题目描述

**Problem Statement:**

```

The number N is called “Psycho Number” . Psycho Number is calculated as follows:

First, If we factorize N , then we have some prime and their power. Assume that, there are M powers. From M powers , you should count the number of even and odd powers. Then if the number of even power is strictly greater than odd power , then we call the number N is “Psycho Number”, otherwise the number N is call “Ordinary Number”.

As for example, if N = 67500 then prime factorization, 67500 = 22 x 33 x 54. Count even powers and odd powers . This number have 2 even power(2,4) and 1 odd power ( 3 ). Since even power 2 (2,4) is greater than odd power 1 (3), so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.

Now , You have to find the psycho number or Ordinary Number of the following function:

bool isPsycho( long long K, long long b, long long p)

{  

       N = numberoftrailingzeros ( K ! ) * lastdigit ( bp ) ;

if( N == psychonumber )  return true; 

 else

return false;

}

```

For example , if k = 10 , b= 12 , p = 1 then the N is 4 and it's a psycho number.

10 ! = 3628800 , number of trailingzeros is 2.

12 $ ^{1} $ $ ^{} $ = 12 , last digit is 2.

so N = 4 then 4 = 2 $ ^{2} $ . even power is greater than odd power, so the number 4 is a Psycho Number.**Input:**

An integer **T** (1<= **T** <=10 $ ^{5} $ ) denoting the number of test cases followed by T lines. Each line containing **K** (1<= **K** <=4\*10 $ ^{6} $ ), **b** (0<= **b** <=10 $ ^{4} $ ), and **p** (0<= **p** <=10 $ ^{17} $ ).

**Output:**

For each case print “**Psycho Number**” or “**Ordinary Number**”.

**Sample Input/Output:**

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**

**2**

**5 2 5**

**10 12 1**

**Ordinary Number**

**Psycho Number**

```

 

Note : 0 and 1 is not a psycho number .

Psycho 1 : Psycho

Psycho 3 : Make Psycho 

```

`Psycho 4 : Psycho34 (easy) ` ```
