## 题意翻译

$n,m$表示农田的大小，$k$表示农田的单位面积，求由`H`构成 最大的子矩形（长宽与边框平行）的面积，可以认为是 矩形大小 乘以 单位面积

## 题目描述

Chief Farmer Josef aka Sepp needs to crop hay several times through the summer. Due to high petrol costs he can currently use his truck only once to drive to a spot where he will harvest the dried grass. Lazy by nature, John does not want to harvest those parts of the field which contain cows, since this would involve too much energy. Furthermore, John just crops a rectangular part of the field.

**Input**

Input contains multiple test cases. You are given three integers M, N, F (0 < M, N <= 4000), (0 <= F <= 1000000) which describe the size of the field (M rows, N columns, F unit area of such a field). Then follows the actual map which consists of M lines, each line containing N times the letters 'H' or 'C' standing for "Hay" or "Cow". Input terminates with M = N = 0.

**Output**

Print the size of the largest field, which "Sepp" would harvest.
