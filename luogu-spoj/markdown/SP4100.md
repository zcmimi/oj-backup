# MVECTOR - Sum of Vectors

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/MVECTOR/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MVECTOR/vn/)We can represent a 2D vector as a pair (X,Y). The sum of two or more vectors is a vector whose coordinates are the sums of the corresponding coordinates of all the vectors in the sum. e.g. (1,2)+(3,4)+(5,6) = (1+3+5,2+4+6) = (9,12) Weight of a vector (x,y) is defined as x\*x+y\*y. You are given N vectors on a plain.

Your task is to write a program that will determine a subset of those vectors so the weight of the sum of all vectors in that subset is maximal.

Note: Use 64-bit integers (int64 in pascal or long long in c)

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

In the first line of the input file is an integer N, 1

The following N lines contain descriptions for each of the vectors. A description is made of two integers X and Y, separated by a single blank, -30,000

None of the given vectors will be (0,0)

### 输出格式

In the first and only line of the output file you have to write the weight of the maximum sum.
