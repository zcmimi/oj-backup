## 题目描述

```

jhon is compulsive saver, he keeps and amount "n" of piggy banks locked in his room.

He has a list which he wrote with a sequence of 1's and 2's that indicate the way that Jhon will 

deposit his money on the piggy banks. Every time Jhon gets a penny he rushes to his room and 

picks the 2 piggy banks who have the less amount of money, then he looks at the next number 

on the sequence. If that number is one (1) he deposits the penny on the piggy bank with the lesser 

amount of money. If that number is two (2) he deposits the penny on the next piggy bank with 

the lesser amount of money.

Your task is to write a program to help Jhon to determine what is the amount in the 2 piggy 

banks with less money once the sequence is over

if more than two have the lowest amount of money choose those with lowest indexes.

```
