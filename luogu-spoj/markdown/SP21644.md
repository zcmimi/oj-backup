# WALLSPRO - Walls

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述：

在一片没什么特别的沙漠里有许多研究站，可以看做是笛卡尔平面，有站点位于坐标（x，y），其中x，y均为整数，出于安全原因，需要建造高且长的墙来分隔站点，使得其他站点都看不到本站点，墙壁只能沿着南北或东西方向建造，垂直墙壁可以构建在奇数x坐标处，水平墙壁可以构建在奇数y坐标处，由于这些站点位于偶数坐标，并且墙壁是沿着奇数坐标建造的，因此没有墙壁可以接触到站点。墙壁总是足够长，一便把站点完全分开。

## 输入输出格式：

#### 输入格式：

多组数据，，每组数据都有一个整数n，每行包含x，y，表示站点的坐标，保证x，y均为偶数，并且所有的x，y都是唯一的，最后以0结尾。

##### 输出格式：

输出防止站点两两之间可以相互看见的站点的最小值，连接任何两个站点的边线必须与至少一个墙相交，不要用空行分隔答案。

## 题目描述

There are a number of research stations on a featureless patch of desert, which can be modeled as a Cartesian plane. Each station is located at some point **(x,y)** where **x** and **y** are even integers. For security reasons, sufficiently long and high walls are to be constructed to separate the stations so that no station is visible from any of the other stations. A wall may only be constructed along a North-South or East-West line. A vertical wall may be built at an odd x-coordinate, and a horizontal wall may be built at an odd y-coordinate. Since the stations are located at even valued coordinates, and the walls are built along odd valued coordinates, no wall can ever touch a station. The walls are always long enough to completely separate stations on one side from stations on the other side.

Given a list of stations, you must determine the smallest number of walls that need to be constructed.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will begin with an integer **n** (2nn lines each will contain two integers **x** and **y** (0x,**y**x,**y**) location of a station. The **x** and **y** values are guaranteed to be even. Within a test case, all (**x**,**y**) locations will be unique. The last test case will be followed by a line with a single 0.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer, indicating the smallest number of walls that can prevent the given **n** stations from seeing each other. That is, a straight line-segment joining any two stations must be intersected by at least one wall. Output no extra spaces, and do not separate answers with blank lines.
