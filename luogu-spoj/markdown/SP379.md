# PERMUT2 - Ambiguous Permutations

## 题目描述

 Some programming contest problems are really tricky: not only do they require a different output format from what you might have expected, but also the sample output does not show the difference. For an example, let us look at permutations.

A **permutation** of the integers _1_ to _n_ is an ordering of these integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is to list the integers in this order. With _n = 5_, a permutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1.

However, there is another possibility of representing a permutation: You create a list of numbers where the _i_-th number is the position of the integer _i_ in the permutation. Let us call this second possibility an **inverse permutation**. The inverse permutation for the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.

An **ambiguous permutation** is a permutation which cannot be distinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2 for example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same. To get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a program which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.
