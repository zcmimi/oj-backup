# WOWSUBSTR2 - Counting WOW-Substrings2

## 题目描述

```

You are given a string. You have to count the total lengths of all WOW substrings.

WOW substrings are defined as a contiguous substring of a string

where there is no any character occurring more than one times.

That means, all the characters of substring are unique.

As answer could be very large, so print it modulo 100007. (NOTE THAT: 100007 is not a prime number!!)

```

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input starts with an integer **TC**(<=50), denoting the number of test cases.

Each case starts with N and M, denoting respectively length of string and

total characters of string represented as integers from 1 to M. Then,follows

a line with space separated N integers ( each in the range 1 to M ).

Input starts with an integer TC(<=50), denoting the number of test cases.Each case starts with a string S.

### 输出格式

For each case, print the case number and total lengths of all WOW substrings of given string modulo **100007**.
