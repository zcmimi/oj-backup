# MAXI - Get higher and higher

## 题目描述

You are travelling to Kullu Manili, a hill station in India. You saw some huge mountains and very curious to climb the highest ones. Assume that there are **n** mountains of height **hi** given.

But you were wondering about what could be the total height i need to climb if I climb only the mountain of maximum height only in a segment of k continuous mountains, considering all k segements possible. You want to calculate this for all k, such that 1<=k<=n.

Mathematically, we need to find the sum of maximum element in each possible continuous segment of size k.
