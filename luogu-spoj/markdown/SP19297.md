# WPC5H - Nymphs from H10

## 题意翻译

# 题目描述

一个遥远的星系H10最近被发现并被并入参与银河战争的一个联邦，同时其他星系每年都通过赢得银河战争来威胁它。令人沮丧的是，H10想出了一个新的策略来分散其他星系的注意力。他们计划把美丽的仙女送到其他星系。

宇宙的排列使得任何两个星系之间都有独特的路径（可能经过其他星系）。H10的领导者将选择两个不同的星系A和B，并将K个仙女发送到从A到B的路径上的每个星系。最初，在任何星系中都没有仙女。

你是这个项目的首席执行官。领导们会发布特定样式的命令（A，B，K），来让你发送这些仙女。在这个过程中，他们也学会问你在某个特定的星系中有多少个仙女，以便在未来做出明智的决定。请编程实现这一点。（具体输入格式请参阅输入/输出样例）

## 题目描述

A far away galaxy, H10 has newly been discovered and incorporated into the Commonwealth which participates in the Galactic Wars. The other galaxies have always bullied it by winning the Galactic Wars every year. Frustrated, H10 has come up with a novel strategy to distract the other galaxies. They are planning to send beautiful nymphs into the lands of the other galaxies.

The cosmos is arranged so that there is a unique path between any two galaxies (possibly going through other galaxies). The leaders in H10 will select two different galaxies A and B, and send K nymphs to each of the galaxies that is on the unique path from A to B. Initially there are no nymphos on any galaxy.

You are the Chief Executive Officer of this project. The leaders will ask you to send these groups of nymphs by giving various instructions of the form (A,B,K). In the process, they may also ask you how many nymphs are currently there in particular galaxies, so that they are able to take smart decisions in the future. Implement this.
