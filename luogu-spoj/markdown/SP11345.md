# ADDLCM - lcm addition

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

Mao数学很好，他喜欢玩数论，数论是他最喜欢的一章。有一次他决定向他的朋友Kalyu提问。但是现在Kalyu总是忙于写文章，所以他不能花太多时间来解决这个数学问题，但他也不想伤害他的朋友，所以请你帮助Kalu解决Mao的问题。

给定a，b(a<=b)计算出加法的结果：

lcm（a，b）+lcm（a+1，b）+..+lcm（b，b），其中lcm（a，b）表示整数a和b的最小公倍数。

因为输出可能非常大，所以结果取模10^9+7。

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式：

第一行测试数据t，下面t行每一行包含a和b。

### 输出格式：

t行答案输出。

## 题目描述

Mao is very good in mathematics, he likes to play with numbers and number theory is his favorite chapter. Once he decided to give a question to kalyu his friend . Now Kalyu is always busy in writing articles, as he likes maths but articles is his passion and source of income too, so he can’t give much time solving that maths question, but he too don’t want to hurt his friend, so help kalu in his problem ?

Given a,b such that a<=b calculate the addition:-

LCM(a,b) + LCM(a+1,b) + .. + LCM(b,b), where LCM(a,b) denotes the Least Common Multiple of the integers a and b.

Since, output may be very large, take the mod 10^9+7

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line cosists of T=number of test cases, next T line will contain a and b

### 输出格式

For each T lines, print the required output.
