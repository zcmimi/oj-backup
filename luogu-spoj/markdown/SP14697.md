# LOOPEXP - Loop Expectation

## 题目描述

Consider the following pseudo-code

int a\[1..N\];

int max = -1;

for i = 1..N:

if(a\[i\] > max)

max = a\[i\];

Your task is to calculate the expected number of times the 'if' block of the above pseudo-code executes. The array 'a' is a random permutation of numbers from 1..N chosen uniformly at random.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains t, the number of test cases. t lines follow, each containing N, the number of elements in the array.

1<= t <= 100

1<= n <=100,000

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single decimal. Your answer should be within 10^-6 of the correct answer.
