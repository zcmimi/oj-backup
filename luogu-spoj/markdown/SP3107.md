# ODDDIV - Odd Numbers of Divisors

## 题目描述

Given a positive odd integer K and two positive integers low and high, determine how many integers between low and high contain exactly K divisors.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a positive integer C (0 < C < 100,000), the number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of a line containing three integers: K, low, and high (1 < K < 10000, 0 < low

### 输出格式

Output for each case consists of one line: the number of integers between low and high, inclusive, that contain exactly K divisors.
