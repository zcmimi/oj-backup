# AMR10C - Square Free Factorization

## 题目描述

 You all know about factorization of an integer. Here we want you to factor a number into as few factors as possible. That is easy, you say, just have the number itself, and that will be the smallest number of factors i.e. 1.

But wait, I haven't finished -- each of the factors that you find must be square-free. A square-free number, however you factor it, won't have any factor that is a perfect square. Of course, you can never include 1 as a factor.

## 输入输出格式
