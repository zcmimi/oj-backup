# ROOTCIPH - Decipher

## 题目描述

Radar scanned the approaching enemy aircraft on the border. However due to some error part of the tranmitted data can't be deciphered. It was possible only to obtain the coefficients of the cubic polynomial, whose roots are the coordinates of the aircraft relative to the radar. Now you need to calculate the distance to the aircraft. Write the program to solve this task.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains T (1 <= T <= 1000) - number tests. The next T lines contain three integers a, b and c - coefficients of the polynomial _x_ $ ^{3} $ + _ax_ $ ^{2} $ + _bx_ + _c_, whose roots are the coordinates (the absolute value of the coordinates do not exceed 10 $ ^{8} $ ).

### 输出格式

For each test print the square of the distance to the enemy aircraft.
