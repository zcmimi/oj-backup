# MINSUB - Largest Submatrix

## 题目描述

You are given an matrix M (consisting of nonnegative integers) and an integer K. For any submatrix of M' of M define min(M') to be the minimum value of all the entries of M'. Now your task is simple: find the maximum value of min(M') where M' is a submatrix of M of area at least K (where the area of a submatrix is equal to the number of rows times the number of columns it has).

The first line contains a single integer T (T

### 输出格式

For each test case output two integers: the maximum value of min(M'), where M' is a submatrix of M of area at least K, and the maximum area of a submatrix which attains the maximum value of min(M'). Output a single space between the two integers.
