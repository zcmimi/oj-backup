# TEAM2 - A Famous ICPC Team

## 题意翻译

B先生，G先生，M先生和他们的教练S正计划前往华沙参加ACM-ICPC世界总决赛。他们四个中的每一个都有一个方形手提箱，边长分别为$A_i$（1 <= i <= 4）。 他们想把所有的行李箱装进一个大方箱里。 大箱子和四个手提箱的高度完全相同。 所以他们只需要考虑大箱子的边长。 编写一个程序来输出大盒子的最小边长，这样四个手提箱就可以放入盒子而不会重叠。

## 题目描述

Mr. B, Mr. G, Mr. M and their coach Professor S are planning their way to Warsaw for the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of the four has a square-shaped suitcase with side length A $ _{i} $ (1 <= _i_ <= 4) respectively. They want to pack their suitcases into a large square box. The heights of the large box as well as the four suitcases are exactly the same. So they only need to consider the large box’s side length. Of course, you should write a program to output the minimum side length of the large box so that the four suitcases can be put into the box without overlapping.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Each test case contains only one line containing 4 integers A $ _{i} $ (1<= _i_ <=4, 1<= A $ _{i} $ <=1,000,000,000) indicating the side length of each suitcase.

### 输出格式

For each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the minimum side length of the large box required.
