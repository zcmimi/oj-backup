# GRIDSUM3 - 2x2 Subgrid Sum Problem (generalized)

## 题目描述

This problem is a higher constraints and generalized version of [KWACIK](http://pl.spoj.com/problems/KWACIK/) (Polish) and [GRIDSUM2](../GRIDSUM2/).

![Sample case for k=5, a=1, b=3 and n=8.](../../../content/min_25:grid_5x5.png "Sample case for k=5, a=1, b=3 and n=8.")

You are given a **_k_**x**_k_** grid. You can place an integer _m_ (**_a_** m **b**) in each cell.

How many ways are there to place integers in the cells such that the sum of each 2x2 subgrid is _**n**_ ?

Since the answer might be very large, output it modulo **479001600** (= **12!**).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer **_T_** (1 **T**

On each of the next **_T_** lines, you are given four integers **_k_**, _**a**_, **_b_** and _**n**_.

(2 _k_ _a_ _b_ _n_

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single line containing the number of ways to place integers modulo **479001600** (= **12!**).
