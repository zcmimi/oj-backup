You gladly take the job offer and after a few days of teaching you give the students a program to write. You ask them to write a [FIZZBUZZ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) program. They are either too smart or too lazy. They argue that it is too difficult and callenge you to do better than that without using any english alphabets.
