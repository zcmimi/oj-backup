# DPAIR - Counting d-pairs

## 题目描述

You're given a sequence A of N non-negative integers. Answer Q queries, where each query consists of two integers: a, b. The answer is number of pairs of integers i and j that satisfy these three conditions:

(1) 1 <= i <= j <= N

(2) a <= j-i+1 <= b

(3) all elements of A with indices from range \[i, j\] are mutually distinct. (indexing starts with 1)

**Constraints** :

1 <= N <= 8\*10^5

1 <= Q <= 2\*10^5

0 <= A\[k\] <= 10^6, for every integer k between 1 and N, inclusive

1 <= a <= b <= N

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input contains integer N. Second line contains N integers representing sequence A. Third line is integer Q, number of queries. Next Q lines have 2 integers, a and b.

### 输出格式

In the i-th line output the answer for i-th query.
