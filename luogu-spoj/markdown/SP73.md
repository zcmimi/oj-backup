# BAC - Bacterial

## 题目描述

 In the biology laboratory we are observing several bacterial samples, and under the microscope we have them shaded with different colors to see them expanding their territory on the plate.

It is interesting to know that the bacterial are quite 'friendly' that once they meet each other, they do not expand into each other's occupation any more. The bacterial samples are expanding at similar speeds and we take them as the same speed.

Since the experiment is tedious and lengthy (Oh My God! there are several thousand samples at our pick), we are going to run a simulation based on this reality, taking the variable that these samples may be planted in different starting spots.

We are using rectangular plates and bacterial racing is bounded within the plate.
