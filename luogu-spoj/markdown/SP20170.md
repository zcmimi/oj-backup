# COLORSEG - Coloring Segments

## 题目描述

```

Making a fun is a not a bad thing, but while making a fun if you disrespect someone then it will not be acceptable. Some of the North South University's students has done this type of wrong thing. So as a punishment they have to solve this problem. And you are a friend of them, so you should help them.

 

You will have N segments. Each one is connected in contiguous way. And we can number them from 1 to N. See the following figure:

 

 

 Now you need to paint them, you have some colors, which are numbered from 1 to M. Now you need to count number of ways to paint the segments with the colors, such that this property preserves-

            U = color(i) + color(j)

            V = color(j) + color(k)

            U, V is Coprime.     Here 1 <= i < j < k <= N and j = i + 1, k = j + 1

And i, j, k indicates the index of segments and color(i) means the color you have painted on i th segment.
