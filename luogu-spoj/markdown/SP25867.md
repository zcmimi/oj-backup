# DIVFIBS - Divisible Fibonacci Numbers

## 题目描述

In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is calculated by adding the previous two members of the sequence. The first few fibonacci numbers are

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

Considering the indices start from 1 the 6 $ ^{th} $ fibonacci number in this sequence is 8 and is divisible by 1, 2, 4 and 8. You are given two indices L and R (L<=R) of this sequence and you have to calculate how many fibonacci numbers are divisible by M in range \[L, R\] inclusive.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input begins with a line containing a single integer **T(1<=T<=500)**, denoting the number of test cases. **T** test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing three integers **L R (1<=L<=R<=100000)** and **M (1<=M<=10 $ ^{18} $ )**.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single line containing the answer as an integer.
