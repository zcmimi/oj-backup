## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer **T** (1 ≤ **T** ≤ 50), indicating the number of test cases.

Each test case contains several lines. The first line contains an integer **N** (1 ≤ **N** ≤ 1000), indicating the number of fruit.

The following **N** lines each contains three integers **X** $ _{i} $ , **Y** $ _{i} $ , **R** $ _{i} $ (-1000 ≤ **X**, **Y** ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ **R** $ _{i} $ ≤ 1000), representing a fruit on the screen, where (**X**, **Y**) is the coordinate of the center of the fruit, and **R** $ _{i} $ is the radius.

You can assume the screen is infinite.

### 输出格式

For each test case in the input, print one line: "Case #X: Y", where **X** is the test case number (starting with 1) and **Y** is maximum number of fruit that you can cut in a single touch.

It is guaranteed that the answer will remain the same even if you expand the radius of all the fruit slightly by 10 $ ^{-5} $ .
