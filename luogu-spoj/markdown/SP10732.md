# TRAPEZBO - Trapezoid

## 题目描述

Consider two arbitrarily chosen horizontal lines. A trapezoid Ti between these lines has two

vertices situated on the upper line and the other two vertices on the lower line (see figure below).

We will denote by ai, bi, ci and di the upper left, upper right, lower left and respectively lower right

vertices of the trapezoid Ti. A subset S of trapezoids is called independent if no two trapezoids from

S intersect.

### Task

Determine the cardinality of the largest independent set of trapezoids (the largest set means the set

with most elements). Also find the count of different independent sets with maximum cardinality.

Find this count modulo 30013.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains one integer N – the number of trapezoids. Each of the next N lines

contains four integers ai, bi, ci and di. No two trapezoids have a common vertex (corner).

### 输出格式

The only line of output should contain two numbers separated by space: firstly, the cardinality of

the largest independent set; secondly, the count of different independent sets with maximum

cardinality modulo 30013.
