# ADDGP - Enjoy Adding GP to Series

## 题目描述

 You are initially given an empty array of Size **N** (<=100000). (i.e. each element is 0).

Given 2 <= **R** <=10 $ ^{9} $ .

Now you are given 3 types of query:

1. "0 St i1 i2": means add (St, St\*R , St\*R^2 ,....) GP from i1 to i2 respectively. (Means add the GP with start term St and common ratio R in the series begining from i1 and ending at i2.)

2. "1 i j": means find the sum of values of the array from index **i** to index **j** with modulo 1000000007.

3. "2 i": resets the **i**-th index array to 0.

## 输入输出格式
