# MENU - Menu

## 题意翻译

阿尔弗雷德想计划接下来几天做什么菜。他会做各种各样的菜。每道菜的成本和效益都是已知的。如果一道菜是连续第二次烹饪，第二次的效益值是第一次的50%，如果是连续第三次或更高的时间烹饪，效益值为0。例如，连续三次烹饪一个效益值为v的菜，总效益值为1.5*v。帮助他构建一个菜单，在不超出预算的约束下最大化收益值。

## 题目描述

Alfred wants to plan what to cook in the next days. He can cook various dishes. For each dish the costs of the ingredients and the benefit value is known. If a dish is cooked the second time in a row, the benefit value for the second time is 50 percent of the benefit value of first time, if it is prepared for the third or higher time in a row, the benefit value is 0. For example cooking a dish with benefit value v three times in a row leads to a total benefit value of 1.5\*v.

Help him to build the menu which maximizes the benefit value under the constraint that his budget is not exceeded.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case begins with 3 integers in a line: The number of days _k_ (_1 ≤ k ≤ 21_) Alfred wants to plan for, the number of dishes _n_ (_1 ≤ n ≤ 50_) he can cook and his budget _m_ (_0 ≤ m ≤ 100_). The following _n_ lines describe the dishes Alfred can cook. The i-th line contains two integers: the costs _c_ (_1 ≤ c ≤ 50_) and the benefit value _v_ (_1 ≤ v ≤ 10000_) of the i-th dish.

The end of the input is signaled by a test case with _k = n = m = 0_. You don't need to process this test case.

### 输出格式

For each output, print the maximum benefit value reachable with 1 digit after the decimal point. Then print k integers with i-th integer being the number of the dish to cook on day i. Dishes are numbered from 1 to n. Print at least one space or new line character after each integer.

If there are several possible menus reaching the maximum benefit value, select the one with minimum costs, if there are several with minimum costs, you can print any of them.

If every menu exceeds the budget, print only the benefit value of 0.
