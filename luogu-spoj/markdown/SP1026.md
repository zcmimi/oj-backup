What is the expected number of throws of his die while it has **N** sides so that each number is rolled at least once?

Each test case consists of a single line containing a single integer **N** (1 <= **N** <= 1000) - the number of sides on BuggyD's die.

For each test case, print one line containing the expected number of times BuggyD needs to throw his **N**-sided die so that each number appears at least once. The expected number must be accurate to 2 decimal digits.
