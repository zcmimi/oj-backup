# NY10E - Non-Decreasing Digits

## 题目描述

A number is said to be made up of non-decreasing digits if all the digits to the left of any digit is less than or equal to that digit.For example, the four-digit number **1234** is composed of digits that are non-decreasing. Some other four-digit numbers that are composed of non-decreasing digits are **0011**, **1111**, **1112**, **1122**, **2223**. As it turns out, there are exactly 715 four-digit numbers composed of non-decreasing digits.

Notice that leading zeroes are required: 0000, 0001, 0002 are all valid four-digit numbers with non-decreasing digits.

For this problem, you will write a program that determines how many such numbers there are with a specified number of digits.
