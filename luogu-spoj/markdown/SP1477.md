# PT07A - Play with a Tree

## 题目描述

 Hey, ACRush and Jelly are playing a game ! Let take a look at its rule:

You are given a tree. Two players take turns cutting edges on a tree. Some nodes is on the "ground". When a player cuts an edge, all the edges that are no longer connected to the ground disappear. The player who can not take a move loses.

ACRush plays first. Both of them are very good players. If you know state of the tree they are playing with, can you guess who will win?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 Input consists of multiple test-cases. The first line contains one integer _t_ - number of cases (0 < _t_ <= 20). For each case, the input format is following. The first line contains one integer _N_ (1 <= _N_ <= 100000). The next line _N_ integers s\[i\] (1 or 0). If s\[i\] is 1, the _i_-th node is on the ground. If s\[i\] is 0, the _i_-th node is not on the ground. Each line of the following _N_ - 1 lines contains two integers u, v. They denote there is an edge between node u and node v (1 <= u,v <= N).

There is no blank line after each case.

### 输出格式

 For each case, output who will win the game. If ACRush wins, output _1_; otherwise, output 0 (Jelly wins).

There is no blank line after each case.
