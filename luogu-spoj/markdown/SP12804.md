# SPY2 - Spy

## 题目描述

Blue Mary extremely likes making PPTs. She has already made **L** PPTs. Now the only problem before finish is to set the background pictures for each PPT. She has **N** background pictures, and each PPT needs exactly one background picture. Different PPTs can use same background pictures. Obviously, there are **N $ ^{L} $** combinations.

For each combination, Blue Mary defines its weight as **(k+1) $ ^{-1} $** , where **k** is the number of pictures (from the **N** pictures in total) that do not appear in it. Now Blue Mary wants to calculate the sum of weights of all combinations. (Blue Mary is such a weird girl that she always does some meaningless calculations.) She asks you for help.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Multiple test cases, the number of them is less than 500. Each test case consists of a single line with two space-separated integers **N** and **L**. All input numbers are positive and less than 10 $ ^{6} $ . Input terminates by EOF.

Input data is almost log-uniform randomly generated.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output the required value in a single line. It's guaranteed that this number is always an integer for all input data. Since it can be quite large, output it modulo 10 $ ^{9} $ +2015. (Why not 10 $ ^{9} $ +7? Remember Blue Mary is a weird girl!)
