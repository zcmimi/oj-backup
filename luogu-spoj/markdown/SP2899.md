# VOL - Volunteers

## 题目描述

ACM ICPC World Finals 2009, sponsored by IBM and hosted by KTH, Royal Institute of Technology will be held in Stockholm, Sweden. This contest will last for _N_(1<= _N_ <= 1000) days. We need at least _A $ _{i} $_ volunteers in the _i_-th day. Now there are _M_(1<= _M_ <=10000) kind of volunteers. The _i_-th type of volunteers will work from _S $ _{i} $_ -th day to _T $ _{i} $_ -th day, we will pay them $_C $ _{i} $_ . Now your task is to minimize the money KTH pay for all the volunteers.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Ten test cases(given one after another, you have to process all!). For each test case:

The first line contains two space-seperated integers _N_ and _M_. The second line contains N nonnegative integers _A $ _{i} $_ . _M_ lines follow, each contains three integers _S $ _{i} $_ , _T $ _{i} $_ and _C $ _{i} $_ . You may assume you can hire almost unlimited number of every type of volunteers.

_Tip_: During your calculation, **int** in C/C++/Java or **longint** in Pascal is enough.

### 输出格式

For each test case:

Output one line with an integer - the minimum cost.
