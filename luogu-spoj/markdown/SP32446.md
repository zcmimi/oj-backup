# SANVI - Sanvi and Magical Numbers

## 题目描述

Let us define a **Magical number** as a positive integer number which meets the following criteria on its representation:

```

```

1.) It does not contain any zeros.

2.) Each digits may appears at most twice in it.

3.) The absolute differences between summation of count of non-prime digits and count of prime-digits do not exceed K.

```

```

Sanvi likes numbers which are not prime. So, **she wants to allow at most M non prime numbers to violate the rule number-2** . Sanvi also uses following algorithm in rule number-3 to calculate count of each digit **d** in a number:

 ```

```

count( d ) = min( total occurrences of d in number, 2 )

```

```

You are given an integer number **N**. Your task is to find the total Magical numbers in the range from **1** to **N** following Sanvi's command. Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo **10^9+7**.

    输入格式

    

    Input contains several test cases up to **EOF** (End Of File), which contains three space separated integers **N ( 1  as described in the problem statement.Total test cases will not exceed **5**.**

    输出格式

    

    Output a single integer denoting the total Magical numbers from **1 to N following Sanvi's command** . Since the answer could be very large print it modulo **10^9+7**.
