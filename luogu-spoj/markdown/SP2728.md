# BREAK - Breaking in

## 题目描述

Mayco has recently been hired as a security consultant for a well-known software company. At the moment, he's working on his first assignment – trying to determine which of the company's servers would be the best targets for potential attackers. It is a bit difficult, though, because some of the servers "trust" some of the others. If an attacker compromises a server, he or she can also freely access all servers that trust it (and servers that trust them, and so on).

By definition, the importance of a server S is the number of servers the attacker would be able to access if he compromised S. The most important servers are those with the highest importance. (Note that there can be more than one most important server. This is also illustrated in the example below.)
