# RAIL - Simplify the Railroad System

## 题目描述

The Slovak national railroad company has recently built new tracks. They want to update their railroad map according to these changes. But they want the map to be as simple as possible. So they decided to remove from the map all the stations that have exactly two other direct connections to other stations (i.e., a single railroad passing through the station).
