## 题目描述

John has got _n_ jars with candies. Each of the jars contains a different kind of candies (i.e. candies from the same jar are of the same kind, and candies from different jars are of different kinds). The _i_-th jar contains _m $ _{i} $_ candies. John has decided to eat some of his candies. He would like to eat at least _a_ of them but no more than _b_. The problem is that John can't decide how many candies and of what kinds he would like to eat. In how many ways can he do it?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains three integers: _n_, _a_ and _b_, separated by single spaces (1 n , 0 a b . Each of the following _n_ lines contains one integer. Line _i+1_ contains integer _m $ _{i} $_ - the amount of candies in the _i_-th jar (0 m $ _{i} $ ).

### 输出格式

Let _k_ be the number of different ways John can choose the candies to be eaten. The first and only line of output should contain one integer: _k_ mod 2004 (i.e. the remainder of _k_ divided by 2004).
