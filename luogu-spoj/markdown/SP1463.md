# ROBOT - Robot Number M

## 题意翻译

# 题目描述

著名的宇航员布鲁·玛丽终于把机器人一号送上了火星。

一号机器人非常聪明，每秒能造出一个机器人。

假设第一个机器人到达的时间是第二个1。在第二个i，机器人1号制造了一个新的机器人:机器人i号。(i > = 2)

新机器人一生产成功就开始工作了。机器人M只在第t秒休息，其中t是M的倍数。

例如，3号机器人在第4、5、7、8秒工作……在第二节6、9、……当一个机器人在休息时，他可以把自己的信息发送给新生产的机器人。

例如，当6号机器人成功生产时，2号机器人和3号机器人休息，所以6号机器人会从2号和3号机器人那里得到信息。

我们称机器人2号和3号是机器人6号的老师。如果两个机器人都不是另一个的老师，并且没有共同的老师，我们称它们为独立的。

请注意，1号机器人是独立于其他机器人的，不是其他机器人的老师，因为只有1号机器人可以制造机器人。

机器人M的生产量数量是在M之前生产出来的独立于M的机器人的数量。这里有一些例子:

机器人1号的数量为0；

2号机器人的数量为1；1号是它的生产者。

6号机器人的数量是2。1号和5号是生产者。

2号和3号是他的老师。

4号和他有一个共同的老师:2号。

机器人有三种职业。机器人No.M:如果M可以写成偶数个奇数素数的倍数，他就是个商人。

如果M可以写成奇数(包括1)的倍数，那么他就是一个黑客。

其他机器人都是医生。

## 题目描述

Blue Mary, the well-known astronaut, had sent Robot No.1 to Mars finally.Robot No.1 was so smart that he could make one robot per second.

Assume the time Robot No.1 arrived was second 1. At second i, Robot No.1 made a new Robot: Robot No.i. (i>=2)

The new robots started work as soon as he was produced successfully. Robot No.M only had a rest at second t, where t is a multiple of M. For example, Robot No.3 worked at second 4,5,7,8,... and had a rest at second 6,9,...

When a robot was having a rest, he could send his own informations to the newly produced robot. For example, when Robot No.6 was produced successfully, Robot No.2 and Robot No.3 are having a rest, so Robot No.6 would get informations from Robot No.2 and No.3. We call Robot No.2 and No.3 are teachers of Robot No.6.

We call two Robots are independent if each of them wasn't a teacher of the other one and they had no common teachers. **Please note that Robot No.1 was independent to any other robots and wasn't a teacher of any other robots,** since only Robot No.1 could make robots.

The good number of Robot No.M is the number of robots who was produced earlier than No.M and independent to No.M. Here are some examples:

The good number of Robot No.1 is 0.

The good number of Robot No.2 is 1. No.1 was that robot.

The good number of Robot No.6 is 2. No.1 and No.5 were those robots. No.2 and No.3 were his teachers. No.4 and him had a common teacher: No.2.

The Robots had 3 kinds of occupations. To Robot No.M:

- If M can be written as the multiple of an even number of distinct odd primes, he was a businessman.

- If M can be written as the multiple of an odd number(1 included) of distinct odd primes, he was a hacker.

- All other robots were doctors.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The very first line contains a single integer T,the number of test cases.T blocks follow.

For each block, the first line contains a single integer K.K lines follow, each contains two integers p $ _{i} $ and a $ _{i} $ separated by a single space.

M = p $ _{1} $ $ ^{a1} $ \* p $ _{2} $ $ ^{a2} $ \* p $ _{3} $ $ ^{a3} $ \* ... \* p $ _{K} $ $ ^{aK} $ .

You can assume that:

- All p $ _{i} $ are distinct primes and are less than 10,000.

- p $ _{1} $ < p $ _{2} $ < p $ _{3} $ < ... All a $ _{i} $ are positive and no more than 1,000,000.

- 1 <= k <= 1000.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output 3 lines.

The first line contains a single integer denotes to the sum of good numbers of all businessmen among Robot No.M and his teachers modudo 10000.

The second line contains a single integer denotes to the sum of good numbers of all hackers among Robot No.M and his teachers modudo 10000.

The third line contains a single integer denotes to the sum of good numbers of all doctors among Robot No.M and his teachers modudo 10000.
