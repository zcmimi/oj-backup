# ADABRANC - Ada and Branches

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug lives on a bush. A typical bush consists of some fruits connected with branches. Ada wants to travel between some fruits. Problem is that each edge can stand only some **X $ _{i} $** weigth (so if some creature with more weigth would like to travel over the edge, it would break and the creature would fall of the bush).

Ada wants to make several travels so she asks you (for each such travel) to how many distinct fruits she can get?
