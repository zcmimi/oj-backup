## 题目描述

**Red & Green**

You have several squares arranged in a single row. Each square is currently painted red or green. You can choose any of the squares and paint it over with either color. The goal is that, after painting, every red square is further to the left than any of the green squares. We want you to do it repainting the minimum possible number of squares.

Squares are numbered from left to right. You will be given the initial arrangement as a String, such that character i is 'R' if square i is red or 'G' if square i is green. Print the minimum number of repaints needed to achieve the goal.
