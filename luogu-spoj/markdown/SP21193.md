They held a diplomatic meeting to reach a compromise. It turns out that when two or more ducks have the same quacking pitch, the sound becomes so constant, that they do not disturb Tomek at all. Fortunately enough, the local veterinarian can alter the pitches of ducks. For changing a duck's quacking pitch fromatob, he demands |b - a| zlotys. How many zlotys does Wojtek have to spend to make it so no duck is alone at its pitch?
