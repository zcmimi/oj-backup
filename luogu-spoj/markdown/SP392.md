The right-most disk can always rotate if it is in position `0' since it has no disk on its right.

The aim is to free the slide by moving it so its left edge aligns with the `Win' mark:

Your task is to write a program which will take several part-solved puzzles and compute the number of steps needed to move the slide to position `Win' for each puzzle.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There will be several puzzles in the input file. The first line of the file will contain an integer _n_ specifying the number of puzzles. There will then be _n_ lines, each of the form:

_length orientations position_

where _length_(length < 30) is an integer indicating the number of disks on the slide, _orientations_ is a string of _length_ characters from the set {h,v} giving the orientation of each disk from left to right (h stands for horizontal, and v for vertical), and _position_ is an integer from 0 to _length_ specifying the numbered mark which aligns with the left edge of the slide.

### 输出格式

For each puzzle, your program should output one integer on a line which counts the minimum number of steps needed to win the puzzle. A step is either a movement of the slide, one unit left or right, or the rotation of a disk.
