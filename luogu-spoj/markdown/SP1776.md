# DNALAB - DNA Laboratory

## 题意翻译

背景

邪恶的医生弗兰肯斯坦最近刚刚开始建立自己的DNA实验室，他还不是最新式的。他想要提取他的DNA，并增强它，克隆自己。他已经知道如何从他的一些血细胞中提取DNA，但不幸的是，阅读DNA序列意味着将DNA分解成若干小段并分析这些片段。弗兰肯斯坦还不太明白如何把碎片拼在一起才能恢复原来的顺序。

他对这个问题的实用主义做法是潜入大学，绑架一些聪明的学生。毫不奇怪，你就是其中之一，所以你最好快点想出一个解决办法。

问题

给你一个字符串列表字母超过（腺嘌呤），C（胞嘧啶）、G（鸟嘌呤），和T（胸腺嘧啶），而你的任务是找到最短的字符串（通常是没有列出的），包含所有给定的字符串的子串。如果有几个这样的字符串长度最短，输出按字典序最小的。

输入

第一行包含测试数据的数量。

对于每个测试数据，第一行n包含字符串的个数，其中1<=n<=15。然后，跟着一些字符串，这些1<=字符串的长度<=100，每行一个，它们由字母“A”、“C”、“G”和“T”组成。

输出

对于每一个测试数据第一行"Scenario #i："，i是测试数据的数目,从1开始。然后输出一条包含如上所述的最短字符串。用一个空行终止测试数据的输出。

## 题目描述

Having started to build his own DNA lab just recently, the evil doctor Frankenstein is not quite up to date yet. He wants to extract his DNA, enhance it somewhat and clone himself. He has already figured out how to extract DNA from some of his blood cells, but unfortunately reading off the DNA sequence means breaking the DNA into a number of short pieces and analyzing those first. Frankenstein has not quite understood how to put the pieces together to recover the original

sequence.

His pragmatic approach to the problem is to sneak into university and to kidnap a number of smart looking students. Not surprisingly, you are one of them, so you would better come up with a solution pretty fast.

You are given a list of strings over the alphabet A (for adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), and T (thymine), and your task is to find the shortest string (which is typically not listed) that contains all given strings as substrings. If there are several such strings of shortest length, find the smallest in alphabetical/lexicographical order.

**Input**

The fist line contains the number of scenarios. For each scenario, the first line contains the number n of strings with 1<=n<=15. Then these strings with 1 <= length <= 100 follow, one on each line, and they consist of the letters ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’, and ‘T’ only.

**Output**

The output for every scenario begins with a line containing “Scenario #i:”, where i is the number of the scenario starting at 1. Then print a single line containing the shortest (and smallest) string as described above. Terminate the output for the scenario with a blank line.
