# IKEYB - I-Keyboard

## 题意翻译

大多数人可能用电话的键盘发信息，但有时写长信息很麻烦，因为一个键必须多按几下才能打出一个字母。一般的电话只有8个键可以用于打字。想要打出这个键所代表的第一个字母，就要按那个键一次，如果要打所代表的第二个字母，就要按两下。不幸的是，有些常用字母需要按三或四次才能打出来。

我们想要安装一个优化过的键盘分配方法。每个键可以代表任意数量个字母，但是要按照字母表顺序排列每个键所代表的字母， 现在我们想要找出最佳的字母分配方法，使得常用的字母可以通过尽可能少的按键次数打出。

输入输出格式：

输入：

输入的第一行有一个正整数t（等于2000）。它代表要遵循的测试用例的数量。每个测试用例以一个包含两个整数k、l（1<=K<=L<=90）的行开始，由一个空格隔开。k是键的数量，L是要对应到这些键上的字母的个数。然后有两行。第一个包含k个字符，每个字符代表一个键的名称。第二行正好包含字母表中字母的L个字符。键和字母代表数字，字母（区分大小写），或任何标点字符（ASCII码在33和126之间）。没有两个键具有相同的字符，没有两个字母是相同的。但是，字母的名称也可以用作密钥的名称。之后的L行，每行都有一个正整数，F1，F2，...，FL。这些数字决定了每一个字母的频率，从第一个字母开始，然后依次排列。数字越大，字母频率越低。没有字母的频率高于100000。

## 题目描述

 Most of you have probably tried to type an SMS message on the keypad of a cellular phone. It is sometimes very annoying to write longer messages, because one key must be usually pressed several times to produce a single letter. It is due to a low number of keys on the keypad. Typical phone has twelve keys only (and maybe some other control keys that are not used for typing). Moreover, only eight keys are used for typing 26 letters of an English alphabet. The standard assignment of letters on the keypad is shown in the left picture:

1

2

abc 3

def 4

ghi 5

jkl 6

mno 7

pqrs 8

tuv 9

wxyz \*

0

_space_ \#

1

2

abcd 3

efg 4

hijk 5

lm 6

nopq 7

rs 8

tuv 9

wxyz \*

0

_space_ \#

There are 3 or 4 letters assigned to each key. If you want the first letter of any group, you press that key once. If you want the second letter, you have to press the key twice. For other letters, the key must be pressed three or four times. The authors of the keyboard did not try to optimise the layout for minimal number of keystrokes. Instead, they preferred the even distribution of letters among the keys. Unfortunately, some letters are more frequent than others. Some of these frequent letters are placed on the third or even fourth place on the standard keyboard. For example, S is a very common letter in an English alphabet, and we need four keystrokes to type it. If the assignment of characters was like in the right picture, the keyboard would be much more comfortable for typing average English texts.

ACM have decided to put an optimised version of the keyboard on its new cellular phone. Now they need a computer program that will find an optimal layout for the given letter frequency. We need to preserve alphabetical order of letters, because the user would be confused if the letters were mixed. But we can assign any number of letters to a single key.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 There is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 2000). It stands for the number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers K, L (1 <= K <= L <= 90) separated by a single space. K is the number of keys, L is the number of letters to be mapped onto those keys. Then there are two lines. The first one contains exactly K characters each representing a name of one key. The second line contains exactly L characters representing names of letters of an alphabet. Keys and letters are represented by digits, letters (which are case-sensitive), or any punctuation characters (ASCII code between 33 and 126 inclusively). No two keys have the same character, no two letters are the same. However, the name of a letter can be used also as a name for a key.

After those two lines, there are exactly L lines each containing exactly one positive integer F $ _{1} $ , F $ _{2} $ , ... F $ _{L} $ . These numbers determine the frequency of every letter, starting with the first one and continuing with the others sequentially. The higher number means the more common letter. No frequency will be higher than 100000.

### 输出格式

 Find an optimal keyboard for each test case. Optimal keyboard is such that has the lowest "price" for typing average text. The _price_ is determined as the sum of the prices of each letter. The price of a letter is a product of the letter frequency (F $ _{i} $ ) and its position on the key. The order of letters cannot be changed, they must be grouped in the given order.

If there are more solutions with the same price, we will try to maximise the number of letters assigned to the last key, then to the one before the last one etc.

More formally, you are to find a sequence P $ _{1} $ , P $ _{2} $ , ... P $ _{L} $ representing the position of every letter on a particular key. The sequence must meet following conditions:

- P $ _{1} $ = 1

- for each i>1, either P $ _{i} $ = P $ _{i-1} $ +1 or P $ _{i} $ = 1

- there are at most K numbers P $ _{i} $ such that P $ _{i} $ = 1

- the sum of products S $ _{P} $ = Sum\[i=1..l\] F $ _{i} $ .P $ _{i} $ is minimal

- for any other sequence Q meeting these criteria and with the same sum S $ _{Q} $ = S $ _{P} $ , there exists such M, 1 <= M <= L that for any J, M<J Q $ _{M} $ .

The output for every test case must start with a single line saying Keypad #I:, where I is a sequential order of the test case, starting with 1. Then there must be exactly K lines, each representing one letter, in the same order that was used in input. Each line must contain the character representing the key, a colon, one space and a list of letters assigned to that particular key. Letters are not separated from each other.

Print one blank line after each test case, including the last one.
