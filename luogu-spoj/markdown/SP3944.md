# MBEEWALK - Bee Walk

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MBEEWALK/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MBEEWALK/vn/) ```

A bee larva living in a hexagonal cell of a large honey comb decides to creep

for a walk. In each “step” the larva may move into any of the six adjacent cells

and after n steps, it is to end up in its original cell.

Your program has to compute, for a given n, the number of different such larva walks.
