# BOBERT - Stick values

## 题目描述

On a sunny day, Stjepan and Bobert were arguing over their problem solving skill under a big apple tree. Bobert brought up a nice problem he had just recently solved and claimed that Stjepan could not solve it. Stjepan is desperate and needs your help. Here is Bobert's problem:

Given an array of **N** (1 <= N <= 10^5) numbers (0 <= **ai** <= 10^9) and **K** (1 <= K <= 20) sticks of a certain length **Li** (0 <= Li <= N, such that the sum of all lengths is equal to N), find the best possible distribution of the sticks among the array such that:
