# MKTHNUM - K-th Number

## 题意翻译

题目大意：

给你n个数，多次询问某段区间第k小的数。

输入格式：

第一行两个数n、m，n代表有多少个数，m代表询问数。

第二行n个数给出，不超过10^9。

接下来m行，每行三个数i,j,k，询问第i个数到第j个数中第k小的数是什么。

输出格式：

输出共m行，对每次询问的回答。

数据范围：

1<=n<=100000,1<=m<=5000。

~~注意：简单的做法可是过不了的。~~

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MKTHNUM/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MKTHNUM/vn/) You are working for Macrohard company in data structures department. After failing your previous task about key insertion you were asked to write a new data structure that would be able to return quickly k-th order statistics in the array segment.

That is, given an array a\[1 ... n\] of different integer numbers, your program must answer a series of questions Q(i, j, k) in the form: "What would be the k-th number in a\[i ... j\] segment, if this segment was sorted?"

For example, consider the array a = (1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 7, 4). Let the question be Q(2, 5, 3). The segment a\[2 ... 5\] is (5, 2, 6, 3). If we sort this segment, we get (2, 3, 5, 6), the third number is 5, and therefore the answer to the question is 5.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of the input contains n — the size of the array, and m — the number of questions to answer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000).

The second line contains n different integer numbers not exceeding 10^9 by their absolute values — the array for which the answers should be given.

The following m lines contain question descriptions, each description consists of three numbers: i, j, and k (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ j - i + 1) and represents the question Q(i, j, k).

```

SAMPLE INPUT

### 输出格式

```

For each question output the answer to it — the k-th number in sorted

a[i ... j] segment.

SAMPLE OUTPUT

5
