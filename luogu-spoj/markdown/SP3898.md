# PALDR - Even Palindrome

## 题目描述

 [Vietnamese](/problems/PALDR/vn/) [English](/problems/PALDR/en/)Palindrome is a string that has the property of reading the same in either direction (left to right or right to left). You are to determine whether a given string can be expressed as a concatenation of palindromes of even length.

Note: A string can be formed by concatenation of any number of even palindrome strings.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains **T** (T < 100), the number of test cases. **T** lines follow, each containing the string corresponding to that particular test case.

**Note:**

There might be a new-line character (i.e. '\\r' in C++) at the end of each line. Be careful with your languages.

### 输出格式

Output consists of **T** lines, one corresponding to each test case. You should output _YES_ if the string can be expressed as concatination of even length palindromes and _NO_ otherwise.
