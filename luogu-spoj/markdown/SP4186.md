# HS08CODE - Break a New RSA system

## 题目描述

Today, Gerrob's RSA company has featured a New RSA cryptosystem: its public key is _n_, the secret keys are three distinct primes _p_, _q_ and _r_, where _n_=_p_\*_q_\*_r_. Note that the ordinary RSA uses only 2 primes! Unfortunately some hackers have stolen a DVD from the company. It does not store the secret keys, only some information about the system, namely, the values of:

φ (_n_) - Euler's totient function and

σ (_n_) - the sum of the divisors.

Obviously you know also _n_, because that's public.

Now, Gerrob's RSA employees are trying to determine if hackers will be able to break the system. Could you help them to answer this question?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer _T_, the number of test cases, where _T_≤ 20000. The following _T_ lines each contains three numbers n, φ (_n_) and σ (_n_) in this order. There are 5 input sets.

### 输出格式

Output _T_ lines, the values of _p_, _q_ and _r_ in increasing order. It is guaranteed that _p_, _q_, _r_<10 $ ^{6} $ .
