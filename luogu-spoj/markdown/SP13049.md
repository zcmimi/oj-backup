# AMR12K - The Loyalty of the Orcs

## 题目描述

'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered Aragorn. 'These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of the great Orcs with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. Maybe there was some dispute about the road.' - Aragorn describing the nature of Orcs.
