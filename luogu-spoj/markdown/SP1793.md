# GEN2 - Text Generater II

## 题目描述

[HL](http://www.spoj.com/users/g201513), [HJ](http://www.spoj.com/users/lcosvse) and [FGD](http://www.spoj.com/users/xilinx) set problem for [ZMY](http://www.spoj.com/users/zmy) everyday. The title of each problem bores them very much. The title is a string which consists only lower case letters. It's length is _L_, and, of course, the title must contain their names(hl, hj, fgd) as consecutive substrings.More apparently, _N_ evil consecutive substrings should not appear in the title. Any string satisfying the two conditions above is OK.

The task ZMY is to do today is: if they give ZMY 8 problems every week, and the title of each problem should not be repeated, how many (complete) weeks can they set problems?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Multiple test cases.Input terminates by EOF.

For each test case:

The first line contains two space-seperated integers L(0<=L<=10 $ ^{9} $ ) and N(0<=N<=20). N lines follow, each contains a string (contains only lowercase letters), which is evil.You can assume the total length of the N evil strings is no more than 20.

### 输出格式

For each test case output one line contains the answer modudo 1000.
