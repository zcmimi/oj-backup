# NINJA4 - HELP SHELDON

## 题目描述

**Problem statement:**

Dr. Sheldon Cooper builds a MVPD replication of himself which he calls a "Mobile Virtual Presence Device" (MVPD) that would go through all the hazards of life that he would otherwise have to

experience while he stays behind in a "secure, undisclosed location". Now the MVPD is initially standing at the origin of the Cartesian coordinate system, (0, 0). (More like Sheldon's spot (0, 0, 0, 0)). Then

the MVPD makes N turns:-

-  On the first turn, the MVPD goes 1 unit to the right.

-  On the second turn, the MVPD goes 2 units up.

-  On the third turn, the MVPD goes 3 units to the left.

-  On the fourth turn, the MVPD goes 4 units down.

- On the fifth turn, the MVPD goes 5 units to the right.

- And so on.

Given an integer N, find the position of Sheldon's MVPD so that he won't get lost somewhere.

**Input Format**

 The first line contains a single integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.

 For each test case, a single line contains a single integer - the value of N.

Output format:

 For each test case output a single line, containing two integers - the coordinates of the MVPD after performing N turns.

**Constraints:**

1 <= T 

1 <= N 

**Sample input:**

2

4

**Output:**

-2 2

-2 -2
