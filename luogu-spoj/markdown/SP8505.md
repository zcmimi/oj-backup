# NACCI - Nacci Fear

## 题目描述

We all know about the classical fibonaaci series, Fibonacci series is F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2). For this question we call it a 2-Nacci series as a new element is calculated as the sum of the last 2 terms of the series. For fibonaaci we assume F(0)=0 and F(1)=1. We define as new series N-Nacci where F(n) is the sum of the last n terms and here we assume that F(0)=0, F(1)=1,F(2)=2... F(n-1)=(n-1). Your task is to calculate the last K digits of the Lth term of the N-Nacci series(no leading zeros needed).

Constraints

2<=N<=30

K<=8

L<=1000000000

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input denotes the number of test cases t(atmost 10). Each line denotes a test case consisting of N,K,L.

### 输出格式

For each test case print the last K digits of the Lth term of the N-Nacci series.
