# TETRAVEX - Tetravex Puzzle

## 题目描述

TetraVex is a challenging computer brain teaser. The object of the game is to fill the grid with the tiles so that the numbers on the adjacent edges of each tile match, much like aligning domino tiles.

Given the 9 tiles, you have to find out whether it is possible to solve the puzzle. Each tile is represented using 4 digits. A tile is given in the order A B C D in the clockwise direction starting from top cell. So the top left tile is denoted as ‘2 1 4 9’ and the bottom right as ‘2 1 6 6’. You cannot rotate the tiles, that is the original order must be preserved.
