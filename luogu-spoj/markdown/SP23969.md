# JARJAR - Helping Jar Jar Binks

## 题目描述

A job has been assigned to Jar Jar Binks, it goes as follows:

There are N spaceships parts, each with a weight of Wi kg. Given a weight W, he has to show how many parts can be used in order to make a ship with a weight of exactly W kg. He has to show all possible solutions, of course if possible.

Everybody knows Jar Jar Binks particularly because of his clumsiness, so you have to help him. Write a program that solves his problem!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There will be several cases, each beginning with two integers N, Q (1<=N<=60, 0<=Q<=10000).

Next there will be N positive integers representing the weights of the N spaceship parts (1<=Wi<=1000).

Q lines will follow, each one with only one (not necessarily positive) integer W, the total weight of the spaceship.

End of input will be denoted with N = 0 and Q = 0. This case should not be processed

### 输出格式

Print a line with K integers per query in ascending order. They must represent the amount of pieces that can be used to make a spaceship with weight W.

If there is no way to make a spaceship with weight W, output a line with the string “That's impossible!” (quotes to clarify)
