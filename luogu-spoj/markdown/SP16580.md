# QTREE7 - Query on a tree VII

## 题意翻译

一棵树,每个点初始有个点权和颜色(输入会给你)

$0$ $u$ :询问所有$u,v$ 路径上的最大点权,要满足$u,v$ 路径上所有点的颜色都相同

$1$ $u$ :反转$u$ 的颜色

$2$ $u$ $w$ :把$u$ 的点权改成$w$

$color_i\in[0,1],w_i\in[-10^9,10^9],n,m\le10^5$

## 题目描述

You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with n nodes. The tree nodes are numbered from 1 to **n**. Each node has a color, white or black, and a weight. We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:

- **0 u**: ask for the maximum weight among the nodes which are connected to **u**, two nodes are connected if all the node on the path from **u** to **v** (inclusive **u** and **v**) have a same color.

- **1 u**: toggle the color of **u**(that is, from black to white, or from white to black).

- **2 u w**: change the weight of **u** to **w**.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a number **n** denoted how many nodes in the tree(1 n n-1 lines, each line has two numbers (**u**, **v**) describe a edge of the tree(1 u, **v** n number, the first line is the initial color of each node(0 or 1), and the second line is the initial weight, let's say Wi, of each node(|**Wi**| m denoted how many operations we are going to process(1 m m lines, each line describe a operation (**t**, **u**) as we mentioned above(0 t u n, |**w**|

### 输出格式

For each query operation, output the corresponding result.
