# MANGOES - Real Mangoes for Ranjith

## 题目描述

Ranjith is very fond of mangoes. One fine sunny day, he goes to market to get some mangoes. In the market place, he finds _N_ boxes (indexed from 1 to _N_), filled with mangoes kept infront of him. Each box indexed _i_ is denoted by _b $ _{i} $_ and contains exactly _i_ mangoes. The number of mangoes in _b $ _{i} $_ is denoted by _m $ _{i} $_ and _m\_i_ = _i_. Let _t $ _{i} $_ denotes the type of mangoes in box _b $ _{i} $_ (_t $ _{i} $_ is either "real" or "fake"). He can choose any box _b $ _{i} $_ (_i_ <= _N-2_), but he doesn't know if the box contains "real" mangoes or "fake" mangoes i.e. type of box _b $ _{i} $_ .

The type of mangoes in _b $ _{i} $_ depends on the number of mangoes in boxes _b $ _{i} $_ , _b $ _{i+1} $_ , _b $ _{i+2} $_ i.e. {_m $ _{i} $_ , _m $ _{i+1} $_ , _m $ _{i+2} $_ }. Mangoes in box _b $ _{i} $_ are "real" if for each pair of numbers taken from set {_m $ _{i} $_ , _m $ _{i+1} $_ , _m $ _{i+2} $_ }, Greatest common divisor(GCD) equals 1. Otherwise, "fake". Note that _t $ _{i} $_ is not defined for _i_ = _N-1_ and _i_ = _N_ and assumed to be "fake".

Given _N_, Ranjith wants to know the total number of "real" mangoes he will get from all boxes. As Ranjith cannot count beyond _N_, output the result modulo _N_.
