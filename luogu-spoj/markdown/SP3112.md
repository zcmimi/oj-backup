# STSTRING - Strings

## 题目描述

Given two strings A and B, we define the operator ĉ on {A,B} for string C as C ĉ {A,B}.

```

if length(A) < length(C) 

else

if length(A)=length(C), then C must be lexicographically greater than A.

if length(B)=length(C), then C must be lexicographically smaller than B.

```

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Given two strings A,B with length(A) < = length(B) <= 6. A,B can contain any characters between A and J (capital letters).

### 输出格式

Print the number of strings satisfying the above criteria. C must also satisfy criteria of A and B. Any two adjacent characters in string C may neither be the same nor consecutve (i.e. the absoulte difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters is greater than 1).
