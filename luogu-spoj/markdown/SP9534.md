# JZPLIT - Turn on the lights

## 题意翻译

给出一个$n*m$的$01$矩阵，现有一种操作。

点击$(i,j)$位置则使第$i$行和第$j$列$01$翻转。

现要求最后矩阵变成全$0$矩阵，输出点击方案。

输出格式，一个$n*m$的$01$矩阵，$(i,j)$为$1$表示点击了$(i,j)$。

## 题目描述

Recently Zippy received a puzzle. It is an n\*m matrix. In each cell of the matrix, there is a switch and a light. Once he flips the switch in a cell, lights in the same column or the same row as the cell (including itself) change to its opposite state (which means: on->off off->on). Zippy wants to turn on all the lights. Please help him to solve the puzzle.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line, n, m.

The following n lines, each line is a m-length string, represting the original state. (0 means on and 1 means off)

1<=n,m

First line, n, m.

### 输出格式

n lines, each line is a m-length string. It's obvious that if a valid solution exists, there exists a solution that every switch is flipped no more than once. So 1 means the switch is flipped once and 0 means the swtich remains unflipped.

It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.
