# EALP1 - Enough of analyzing, let&amp;#8217;s play

## 题目描述

All of must you know the game of Nim. For those who don’t know, I will describe the game in brief:

**_There are two players and there are N piles. Each pile contains some stones. Player 1 takes the first turn, than player 2, than again player 1 and so on. At each turn, the player chooses any ONE pile, and removes at least one stone from it._** **_The player who makes the last move wins._**

Now given N piles, your task is to find the number of ways Player 1 can start the game so that after his first move, he is in the winning position. That means after Player 1 has removed some stones from any ONE pile, he will surely win the game if he plays optimally no matter how well Player 2 plays the game.

**Input**

Input starts with an integer **T (, denoting the number of test cases.**

Each case starts with an integer **N (1 . The next line contains N integers all less than **1000**. The i $ ^{th} $ integer denotes the number of stones in the i $ ^{th} $ pile.**

**Output**

For each case, print the desired result.
