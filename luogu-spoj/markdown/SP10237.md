# AMR11J - Goblin Wars

## 题目描述

The wizards and witches of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft found Prof. Binn's History of Magic lesson to be no less boring than you found your own history classes. Recently Binns has been droning on about Goblin wars, and which goblin civilization fought which group of centaurs where etc etc. The students of Hogwarts decided to use the new-fangled computer to figure out the outcome of all these wars instead of memorizing the results for their upcoming exams. Can you help them?
