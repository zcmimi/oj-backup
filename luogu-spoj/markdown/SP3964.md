就是你有一笔钱，你要将这笔钱去投资债券，现在有$d$种债券，每种债券都有一个价值和年收益，债券的价值是$1000$的倍数，问你如何投资在$n$年后的获得最大收益。

【输入格式】

第一个为一个整数$M$，表示有$M$组数据。

每组数据第一行有两个整数，表示初始资金(不超过$50000$)和年数$n$。

每组数据第二行为一个整数d($1 le d \le 10$)，表示债券种类。

随后$d$行每行有两个整数，表示该债券的价值和年收益。年收益不会超过债券价值的$10%$。

**所有数据不超过整型取值范围。**

【输出格式】

每组数据，输出n年后获得的最大收益。

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/MTEMP/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MTEMP/vn/)John never knew he had a grand-uncle, until he received the notary’s letter. He learned that his late grand-uncle had gathered a lot of money, somewhere in South-America, and that John was the only inheritor.

John did not need that much money for the moment. But he realized that it would be a good idea to store this capital in a safe place, and have it grow until he decided to retire. The bank convinced him that a certain kind of bond was interesting for him. This kind of bond has a ﬁxed value, and gives a ﬁxed amount of yearly interest, payed to the owner at the end of each year.

```

```

The bond has no ﬁxed term. Bonds are available in different sizes. The larger ones usually give a better interest. Soon John realized that the optimal set of bonds to buy was not trivial to ﬁgure out. Moreover, after a few years his capital would have grown, and the schedule had to be re-evaluated. Assume the following bonds are available:

```

Value Annual interest

4000 400

3000 250

```

With a capital of 10 000$ one could buy two bonds of 4000$, giving a yearly interest of 800$. Buying two bonds of 3000$, and one of 4000$ is a better idea, as it gives a yearly interest of e900. After two years the capital has grown to 11800$, and it makes sense to sell a 3000$ one and buy a 4000$ one, so the annual interest grows to 1050$.

This iswhere this story grows unlikely: the bank does not charge for buying and selling bonds. Next year the total sum is 12850$, which allows for three times 4000$, giving a yearly interest of 1200$. Here is your problem: given an amount to begin with, a number of years, and a set of bonds with their values and interests, ﬁnd out how big the amount may grow in the given period, using the best schedule for buying and selling bonds.

Input

The ﬁrst line contains a single positive integer N which is the number

of test cases.

The ﬁrst line of a test case contains two positive integers:

the amount to start with (at most 1000 000$), and the number of years the

capital may grow (at most 40).
