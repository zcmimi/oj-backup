# ADAUSORT - Ada and Unstable Sort

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug had a lecture about algorithms. She learned that sorting can be done in O(NlogN) time. She also learned concept of **stable sort**. For those who missed the lecture, it means that as long as there are two equal elements in the array their mutual position **won't** change after the sort.

Ada wanted to come up with something new, so she proposed **unstable sort**. It is sort with following property: "As long as there are two equal elements in the array their mutual position **will** change after the sort".

As Ada has only theoretical knowledge about it, she has asked you to construct such algorithm for her.
