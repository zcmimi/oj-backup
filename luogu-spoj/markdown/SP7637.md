# RANJAN05 - Road Map

## 题目描述

There are _x_ villages in Andhere Nagar. Each village has its index — an integer number from 1 to _x_. The capital has index a. All the roads in Andhere Nagar are two-way. The road system is such that there is exactly one path from the capital to each city, i.e. the road map looks like a tree. In Andhere Nagar's chronicles the road map is kept in the following way: for each village _i_, different from the capital, there is kept number _p_ $ _{i} $ — index of the last village on the way from the capital to _i_.

Once the king of Andhere Nagar, Choupat Raja, decided to move the capital from village a to village b. Naturally, after this the old representation of the road map in Andhere Nagar 's chronicles became incorrect. Please, help the king find out a new representation of the road map in the way described above.
