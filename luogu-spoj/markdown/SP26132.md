## 题目描述

**A much easier version of this problem can be found here-[SUMDEC1](http://www.spoj.com/problems/SUMDEC1/).

In case you haven't tried it out,try the first part.**

In this problem,You are given a number.You need to output the sum of the first 1000 decimal places of the square-root of the number(Ignore the Integral part).

For example-if the given number is 2. The square-root of 2 is 1.4142135623.....

So,ignore the number before decimal (1 in this case) and add the first 1000 digits after decimal and output them as result-4482.(in this case)

**NOTE-If the number is a perfect square,the output should be 0.**
