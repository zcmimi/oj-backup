# DCES - Dynamic Congruence Equation System

## 题目描述

Consider the congruence equation system as the following form:

x\[1\] = k1 x\[p1\] + b1 (mod 10007)

x\[2\] = k2 x\[p2\] + b2 (mod 10007)

...

x\[n\] = kn x\[pn\] + bn (mod 10007)

We will ask you to achieve some instructions as the following form:

- A i: Ask the current x\[i\]'s value. (or "-1" for no solution, "-2" for multiply solution.)

- C i k p b: Modify the ith congruence equation to a new one.
