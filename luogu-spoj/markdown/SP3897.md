# CVXPOLY - Convex Polygons

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/CVXPOLY/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/CVXPOLY/vn/)You are given n points in the 2-D cartesian coordinate system. You are to determine the number of convex polygons with 3 or more vertices which can be formed by choosing a subset of the given points. To make matters simple, the input obeys the following conditions:

(1) No 3 points in the input are collinear.

(2) No 2 points will have the same coordinates.

Since the result can be quite large, you are required to output ( result % 1234567 ) instead.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains n, the number of points in the corresponding test case, next n lines contain 2 space separated integers denoting the coordinate of ith point. Absolute value of the coordinates do not exceed 10000.

### 输出格式

T lines each corresponding to the answer of corresponding test case.
