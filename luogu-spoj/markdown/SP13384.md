## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains the number of test cases T. T lines follow. Each line contains a string, which represents the pre-order traversal of a “nice” binary tree. Leaves are represented by the letter ‘l’ and other nodes by the letter ‘n’. The input is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of a nice binary tree.

### 输出格式

Output one line for each test case, containing a single integer, the depth of tree.
