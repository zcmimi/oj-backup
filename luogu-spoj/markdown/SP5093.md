# PRETTY - Pretty Functions

## 题目描述

Let S = {1, 2, 3, ..., N}.

For a given positive integer K, the function f : S --> S is called "pretty" if, for every X in S, it holds that

f ( f ( f ( ... f ( X ) ... ) ) ) = X, where f is repeated exactly K times.

How many pretty functions are there, modulo M?
