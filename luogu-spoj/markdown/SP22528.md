# CQM1TREE - Paths in a Tree

## 题目描述

Given a tree and a set of edges **K**, find total number of distinct paths in the tree consisting of all the edges in **K**. Two paths are distinct if the end nodes of the paths are different. Also, a path like (1->2->3) is same as (3->2->1).

A path is defined as a series of edges which connect a sequence of vertices which are all distinct.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line denotes the number of test cases **T** (<=100)

**T** test cases follow.

Each Test case is defined as:

First line contains **n** (1<=n<=2\*10^4) and **k** (

n-1 lines follow, each defining an edge between pair of nodes **u** and **v**.

nodes are numbered 1 to n.

A single line consisting of **k** space separated indices (0-based, in order they appear in the input) of edges which are in the set.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer denoting the number of distinct paths in the tree consisting of all the edges in the set.
