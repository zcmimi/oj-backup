# KEQ - K Equal Digits

## 题目描述

Every once in a while, Mishka Jabereen sends an interesting mathematical puzzle to his friends. This week's puzzle will be about so-called "repetitive" numbers – the ones whose decimal expansion has just one kind of digit in it. (Examples of such numbers include 7, 11, and 5555.) The puzzle is about finding the largest repetitive number subject to two additional restrictions:

```

(A) It must be divisible by at least one number from a given set.

(B) It can not have more than a given number of digits.

```

A concrete example of such a problem statement would be: Find the largest repetitive number with at most 47 digits, which is divisible by 42 or 47! Mishka is currently playing around with a few such problem statements and he'd like to know all the answers, so that he can choose the nicest one.
