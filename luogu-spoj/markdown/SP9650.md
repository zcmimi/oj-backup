# TRIPINV - Mega Inversions

## 题目描述

The n^2 upper bound for any sorting algorithm

is easy to obtain: just take two elements

that are misplaced with respect to each other

and swap them. Conrad conceived an algorithm

that proceeds by taking not two, but three misplaced

elements. That is, take three elements

ai > aj > ak with i < j 

order ak; aj ; ai. Now if for the original algorithm

the steps are bounded by the maximum number

of inversions n(n-1)/2, Conrad is at his wits' end as

to the upper bound for such triples in a given sequence. He asks you to write a program

that counts the number of such triples.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The rst line of the input is the length of the sequence, 1 <= n 

The next line contains the integer sequence a1; a2..an.

You can assume that all ai belongs \[1; n\].

### 输出格式

Output the number of inverted triples.
