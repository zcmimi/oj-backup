## 题意翻译

在学校辛苦了一整天，znr准备好要通过玩电脑游戏《猴子与香蕉》来放松。在游戏中，znr的小猴子被设定在一片丛林中，丛林被简化成一个坐标系。每个横纵坐标都为整数的点代表了一棵树。

猴子一开始在 (XM; YM) 点，正对着(XM; YM + 1) 处的大树。数字键0−7控制猴子。数字K被按下去以后，猴子会向左转K个45度然后跳到他在新方向上能看到的第一棵树。

游戏会持续到猴子跳了N次在这之后，分数会通过结束点和香蕉树之间的距离来计算。香蕉树的位置是 (XB; YB)。距离越小，分数越高。

znr玩了一次游戏。现在他对一件事情感兴趣，就是：他是否可以通过修改刚刚的操作使得他得到的分数变高，并且最多可以修改一次操作。写一个程序计算修改操作后，在游戏结束时，猴子与香蕉树之间距离的最小值（但有可能当前的局面没法更好了)

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/MAJMUN/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MAJMUN/vn/)Coming home after a hard day at school, Ivica is ready to relax playing the computer game "Monkey &banana". In the game, the monkey is located in a jungle, modeled as a coordinate plane.Every point with integer coordinates represents a tree. The monkey is initially located at tree (XM ,YM ) facing up i.e.towards the tree (XM ,YM +1).The monkey is controlled with the keys 0 to 7.When the key K is pressed,the monkey turns 45 degrees left K times and then jumps to the first tree he sees in his new direction.

The game lasts until the monkey jumps exactly N times.After that,the score is calculated from the distance between the monkey and the banana tree,which is located at coordinates (XB ,YB ).The lower the distance,the bigger the score. Ivica played one game and is now interested if he could have done better changing at most one key press. Write a program that determines the smallest possible ending (Euclidean) distance between the monkey and the banana tree (it is possible that the current score cannot be improved).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains our integers XM ,YM ,XB and YB (0 XM ,YM ,XB ,YB 1 000 000),the initial coordinates of the monkey and the coordinates o the banana tree. The next line contains the integer N (1

The last line contains a string o N digits between 0 and 7,the keys that Ivica pressed.

### 输出格式

Output a single decimal number,the smallest achievable distance.Your output must be accurate to ±0.01.
