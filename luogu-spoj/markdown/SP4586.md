## 题意翻译

### 题目描述

给定若干个二维平面上的点，求出一个面积最小的矩形使其能够覆盖所有的点

### 输入数据格式

若干组输入数据。第一行一个正整数$T(1 \leq T \leq 30)$表示测试数据组数。

对于每一组输入数据，第一行一个正整数$N(1 \leq N \leq 30)$表示点的数量，接下来$N$行每行两个整数描述一个点的坐标，保证所有点到原点的距离不超过$500$。

### 输出数据格式

对于每一组输入数据输出一行表示最小的矩形的面积，保留两位小数，当误差不超过$0.01$时视为答案正确。

## 题目描述

After a day trip with his friend Dick, Harry noticed a strange pattern of tiny holes in the door of his SUV. The local American Tire store sells fiberglass patching material only in square sheets. What is the smallest patch that Harry needs to fix his door?

Assume that the holes are points on the integer lattice in the plane. Your job is to find the area of the smallest square that will cover all the holes.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains a single integer T expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, denoting the number of test cases to follow. The subsequent lines of input describe the test cases.

Each test case begins with a single line, containing a single integer n expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, the number of points to follow; each of the following n lines contains two integers x and y, both expressed in decimal with no leading zeroes, giving the coordinates of one of your points.

You are guaranteed that T <= 30 and that no data set contains more than 30 points. All points in each data set will be no more than 500 units away from (0,0).

### 输出格式

Print, on a single line with two decimal places of precision, the area of the smallest square containing all of your points. An answer will be accepted if it lies within 0.01 of the correct answer.
