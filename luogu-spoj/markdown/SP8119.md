# CIRUT - CIRU2

## 题目描述

You are given N **different** circles , while some region may be covered more than once.

If one region is covered by K times, then it was called a "K- Region".

So, you are expected to output the area of all the regions! (K from 1 to N)

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line is one integer n indicates the number of the circles. (1 <= n 

Then follows n lines every line has three integers

Xi Yi Ri

indicates the coordinate of the center of the circle, and the radius. (|Xi|. |Yi| <= 1000, 0 < Ri <= 1000)

### 输出格式

Output N lines, the i-th line output

\[i\] = area\_of\_i\_region

here the area must round to 3 digits after decimal point.
