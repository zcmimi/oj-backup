# SKYLINE - Skyline

## 题目描述

The director of a new movie needs to create a scaled set for the movie. In the set there will be N skyscrapers, with distinct integer heights from 1 to N meters. The skyline will be determined by the sequence of the heights of the skyscrapers from left to right. It will be a permutation of the integers from 1 to N.

The director is extremely meticulous, so she wants to avoid a certain sloping pattern. She doesn’t want for there to be ANY three buildings in positions i, j and k, i < j < k, where the height of building i is smaller than that of building j, and building j’s height is smaller than building k’s height.

Your task is to tell the director, for a given number of buildings, how many distinct orderings for the skyline avoid the sloping pattern she doesn't like.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will consist of a single line containing a single integer N (3

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer, representing the number of good skylines - those avoid the sloping pattern that the director dislikes - modulo 1,000,000. Print each integer on its own line with no spaces. Do not print any blank lines between answers.
