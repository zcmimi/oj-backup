# PSTR - Number of Prime Strings

## 题目描述

A string is called a "prime string" if it can't be written as concatenation of more than one same strings. For example, the following strings are not prime strings: AAA, ABABAB, CFGFGCFGFG, while CFGFGC, ABABA are prime strings.

Calculate the number of prime string of length N (1<=N<=1000000), and only contains first K (1<=K<=26) letters from English alphabet. Note that some of these K letters need not appear in that string.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Multiple test cases. The number of them (about 10000) is given in the very first line.

Each test case contains one line with two integers - K and N, seperated by a single space.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output the required number modulo 1000000007 in a single line.

Example

```

Input:

1

2 3
