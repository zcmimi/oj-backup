# FRSKH - Fibonacci recursive sequences (hard)

## 题目描述

Leo searched for a new fib-like problem, and ...

it's not a fib-like problem that he found !!! Here it is.

Let FIB the Fibonacci function :

FIB(0)=0 ; FIB(1)=1

and

for N>=2 FIB(N) = FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)

Example : we have FIB(6)=8, and FIB(8)=21.

Let F(K, N) a new function:

F(0, N) = N for all integers N.

F(K, N) = F(K-1, FIB(N) ) for K>0 and all integers N.

Example : F(2, 6) = F(1, FIB(6) ) = F(0, FIB( FIB(6) ) ) = FIB( FIB(6) ) = FIB(8) = 21

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.

In each of the next T lines there are three integers: K, N, M.

### 输出格式

For each test case, print F(K, N),

as the answer could not fit in a 64bit container,

give your answer modulo M.
