# LONER - The Loner

## 题目描述

 _The loner_ is a one-dimensional board game for a single player. The board is composed of squares arranged in a single line, some of which initially have pawns on them. The player makes a move by jumping with a pawn over a pawn on an adjacent field, to an empty square two fields to the right or left of its initial position. The pawn that was jumped over is removed directly after the move, as illustrated below.

![The two acceptable types of moves](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP140/b50f821fcafd3d927ab438aa47deb8477d4978d1.png) The game is considered won if exactly one pawn remains on the gaming board, and is lost if the player cannot make a move.

Given the initial state of the gaming board, your task is to determine whether it is possible for the player to win the game.
