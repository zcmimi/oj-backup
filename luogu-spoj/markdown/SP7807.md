# LPRISON - The Lucky Prisoner

## 题目描述

(Maybe) someday there is a planet used to jail much prisoners from universe. One time, the prison manager collects all of prisoners, with handcuff in their hand locked. He orders to officers to unlock all handcuffs. Then, he orders to officers to look at prisoners whose number can divided by two. If his/her handcuff is locked, the open it, otherwise, lock it. Then, he orders again to all officers to look at prisoners whose number can divided by three, and so on.

You, the universe criminal researcher, is requested to calculate the environmental criminal impact by calculating ratio of freed prisoners about all prisoners to the number of prisoners are known.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Line 1 contains one integer T (1 <= T <= 100) number of test cases. Then T next lines contains one number K (1 <= K <= 10 $ ^{1000} $ ), the number of prisoners.

### 输出格式

Output contains K lines, contains the probability of freed prisoners about all prisoners. the probabilty accuration is 10 $ ^{-500} $ with bankers' rounding method.
