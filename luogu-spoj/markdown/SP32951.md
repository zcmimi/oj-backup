Ada the Ladybug was exchanging gifts with her friend. What a surprise - they gave her string. As they like her very much, they brought her a very long string. The goodness of the string is the number of distinct substrings.

As you might already know, each letter has different value so Ada wants to know the number of distinct substrings begining with each letter.
