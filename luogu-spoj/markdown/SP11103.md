## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single integer n. Next line contains n integers(space separated), a1,a2,..,an.

### 输出格式

For each test case, print Case #X: M where M is the number of prime divisors of lcm(a1,a2,..,an) and then M lines with the prime divisors in non-decreasing order.
