# AE5A2 - Quasi-template

## 题目描述

A template of a word v is such a word s that all occurrences of s within v cover the whole word v (i.e. each letter of the word v appears within some fragment of consecutive letters of v equal to s). By quasi-template of a word v we mean such a word s that s is a substring (i.e. a fragment of consecutive letters) of v and s is a template of some superstring of v. The figure below shows why the word aabaa is a quasi-template of the word aaaabaabaaaba:

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line of the standard input contains a non-empty word v that is not longer than 200000 letters. It consists of small letters of English alphabet.

### 输出格式

The first line of the standard output should contain the number of quasi-templates of word v. The second line should contain the shortest word being a quasi-template of word v. If there is more than one such shortest word, output the lexicographically smallest from the shortest quasi-templates.
