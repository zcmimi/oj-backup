# QTREE4 - Query on a tree IV

## 题意翻译

你被给定一棵n个点的带边权的树（边权可以为负），点从1到n编号。每个点可能有两种颜色：黑或白。我们定义dist(a,b)为点a至点b路径上的权值之和。

一开始所有的点都是白色的。

要求作以下操作：

C a 将点a的颜色反转（黑变白，白变黑）

A 询问dist(a,b)的最大值。a,b点都必须为白色（a与b可以相同），显然如果树上仍存在白点，查询得到的值一定是个非负数。

特别地，如果作'A'操作时树上没有白点，输出"They have disappeared."。

## 题目描述

You are given a tree (an acyclic undirected connected graph) with N nodes, and nodes numbered 1,2,3...,N. Each edge has an integer value assigned to it(note that the value can be negative). Each node has a color, white or black. We define dist(a, b) as the sum of the value of the edges on the path from node a to node b.

All the nodes are white initially.

We will ask you to perfrom some instructions of the following form:

- **C a** : change the color of node a.(from black to white or from white to black)

- **A** : ask for the maximum dist(a, b), both of node a and node b must be white(a can be equal to b). Obviously, as long as there is a white node, the result will alway be non negative.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

- In the first line there is an integer N (N <= 100000)

- In the next N-1 lines, the i-th line describes the i-th edge: a line with three integers a b c denotes an edge between a, b of value c (-1000 <= c <= 1000)

- In the next line, there is an integer Q denotes the number of instructions (Q <= 100000)

- In the next Q lines, each line contains an instruction "C a" or "A"

### 输出格式

For each "A" operation, write one integer representing its result. If there is no white node in the tree, you should write "They have disappeared.".
