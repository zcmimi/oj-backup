# DIVFACT3 - Divisors of factorial (hard)

## 题目描述

 Factorial numbers are getting big very soon, you'll have to compute the number of divisors of such highly composite numbers.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer _T_, the number of test cases. On the next _T_ lines, you will be given two integers _N_ and _M_.

### 输出格式

Output _T_ lines, one for each test case, with the number of divisors of the factorial of _N_. Since the answer can get very big, output it modulo _M_.
