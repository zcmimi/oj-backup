Where

**Fib (i)** is the famous Fibonacci sequence such that **Fib (0) =0** , **Fib(1) = 1** and **Fib(i) = Fib(i-1) + Fib(i-2)** for **i>=2**.

**GCD (x,y)** represents the greatest common divisor of **x** and **y**.

Since the answer can be very large, Kid asks Little Detective to find it modulo 1000000007. Help Detective find the answer and tell Kid who is the real artist.
