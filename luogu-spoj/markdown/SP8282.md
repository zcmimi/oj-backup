# DIST - Distance

## 题目描述

You are given the coordinates of N cities (xi,yi). Each city also has a popularity value, pi. You have to place a new city (x,y) such that the sum of distances of this new point from all the other given points is minimized.

Distance of the new point from a given city i is given by :

d = |xi - x| ^ pi + | yi - y | ^ pi

## 输入输出格式

Each testcases starts with the number N, the number of points.

This is followed by the descriptions of each in the format

xi yi pi

The input consists of only integers

### 输出格式

For each testcase, output the minimum distance obtained, with exactly 3 digits after the decimal point.
