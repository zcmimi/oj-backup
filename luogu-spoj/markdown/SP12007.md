# FRS2 - Fibonaccibonacci (easy)

## 题目描述

Leo would like to play with some really big numbers, OK...

Let FIB the Fibonacci function :

FIB(0)=0 ; FIB(1)=1

and

for N>=2 FIB(N) = FIB(N-1) + FIB(N-2)

Example : we have FIB(6)=8, and FIB(8)=21, so FIB(FIB(6))=21

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input begins with the number T of test cases in a single line.

In each of the next T lines there are an integer N.

### 输出格式

For each test case, print FIB(FIB(N)) ,

as the answer could not fit in a 64bit container,

give your answer modulo 1000000007.
