# TWOCIR - Entangled Circles

## 题目描述

 The description of this problem is extremely simple. You are given **2 non-intersecting circles** in 3-dimensional world. Each of the circle is defined by **3 non - collinear points** lying on the circle. All you have to return is whether the circles are entangled or not (just like two links of a chain). Two circles are entangled if they cannot be separated from each other without breaking any of the circles.
