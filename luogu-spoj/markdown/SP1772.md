# DETER2 - Find The Determinant II

## 题目描述

In this problem you have to calculate the determinant of an N x N matrix whose entries are given by **m\[i\]\[j\] = gcd(i,j) $ ^{k} $** , 1 ≤ i,j ≤ N.

Here gcd(i,j) denotes the greatest common divisor of i and j.

As the determinant D can grow very large, you have to print D%1000003.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input consists of a single integer containing the number of test cases T ( equal to around 20), each of the following T lines contain two integers N and k where N is the size of the matrix and k is the exponent.

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000

1 ≤ k ≤ 10 $ ^{9} $

### 输出格式

One line corresponding to each test case containing the determinant modulo 1000003 for the corresponding test case.
