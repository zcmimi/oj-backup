# HC12III - Dead Pixels

## 题目描述

John's friend Peter purchases a new high resolution monitor with dimension **W** \* **H** where **W** is the number of pixels in each row (i.e. width) and **H** is the number of pixels in each column (i.e. height).

However, there are **N** dead pixels on the monitor. The **i**-th dead pixel is located at (**x**\[**i**\], **y**\[**i**\]). (0, 0) is the top-left pixel and (**W** - 1, **H** - 1) is the bottom-right pixel. The locations of the dead pixels could be generated by 6 given integers **X**, **Y**, **a**, **b**, **c** and **d** by the following rules. If 2 pixels are at the same location, they are considered the same. It is possible that there are less than **N** **distinct** dead pixels.
