# MAIN112 - Re-Arrange II

## 题目描述

For a sequence of N integers, A1, A2, ..... AN

We can calculate the stability factor P, as

P = sum of all (abs(A $ _{i} $ -A $ _{i-1} $ )\*C\[i\]) where 2 <= i 

C\[i\] is the cost of putting a number at position i

Your task is find the minimum P for the given N numbers considering all the different permutations of them.

**Input**

First line contains an integer T(1<=T<=10) which denotes the total number of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line contains the integer N(1<=N<=15). The second line contains a space separated list of N integers(<150) which denote the given set of numbers.

The third line contains a space separated list of N integers. The ith integer on this line denotes the value for C\[i\](1 <= C\[i\] < 150)
