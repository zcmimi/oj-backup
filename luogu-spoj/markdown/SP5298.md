# INTERVA2 - Interval Challenge

## 题目描述

Give you N ( 1 <= N <= 200000 ) intervals, represented as \[A, B\], for example , interval s represented as \[As,Bs\].

For two intervals s and t, we say S covered by T if At <= As and Bs <= Bt. Now my problem is easy, just tell me the question below: For each interval, how many intervals can cover it but not covered by it ?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains multiple test cases.

For each test case, the first line is an integer N ( 1 <= N <= 200000 ), which is the number of intervals. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains two integers: A $ _{i} $ and Bi ( A $ _{i} $ , B $ _{i} $ will not exceed the 32-bit integer) specifying the two parameters described above.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing n space-separated integers, the i-th of which specifying the number of intervals that can cover it but not covered by it.
