# MCIRGAME - Point Connection Game in a Circle

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MCIRGAME/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MCIRGAME/vn/) ```

This is a small but ancient game. You are supposed to write down the

numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n − 1, 2n consecutively in clockwise order

on the ground to form a circle, and then, to draw some straight line

segments to connect them into number pairs. Every number must be connected

to exactly one another.

And, no two segments are allowed to intersect. It’s still a simple game, isn’t it?

But after you’ve written down the 2n numbers, can you tell me in how

many diﬀerent ways can you connect the numbers into pairs? Life is harder, right!
