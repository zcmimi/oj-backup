# REPAIR1 - Repair the Door

## 题意翻译

Blue Mary是B37住所的管理员。她用一些神奇的方法得知下学期将有N人进出B37，每个人都有P%的概率打破门。门被打破后，Blue Mary可以立即或过一段时间修理，一次花费A元。当学生穿过大门发现它损坏且没有被修复时，她将把情况报告给校长，Blue Mary将被罚 B 元。开学前门是好的，在学期结束后门也会被修理，所以允许学期结束时门是破的。

Blue Mary的数学很好。她制定了一个方案，决定什么时候修门什么时候不修，使得她的花费最小。

请编写程序计算她付钱的期望值。

## 题目描述

Once upon a time, there was a famous university called Famous University. As thousands of students studied and lived in FU, a gigantic residential building was built, which is called 'B37'. All students lived in B37 happily.

After decades, FU is still as famous as it had been in the past; however, the students living in it are now unhappy, because B37 is too old. Although the door of the building looks fine, it can be easily broken when being opened by some careless student too forcefully.

So, Blue Mary, the accommodation officer of B37, is facing an extremely serious problem.

With some mysterious methods, Blue Mary has predicted that exactly _N_ students will enter or exit B37 during the next term. Unfortunately she doesn't know who the careless ones are, so she assumes that every student opening the door has a probability of _P_ percent to be a careless one. When the door is broken by some careless guy, Blue Mary may repair it immediately or after some time, with a cost of _A_ yuan. Unfortunately when a student goes through the door and finds it already broken and not repaired, she will report it to the headmaster, and Blue Mary will be subject to a fine of _B_ yuan. The door is in good condition before the term begins, and will be repaired by the university after the term ends, so Blue Mary can leave the door unrepaired at the end of the term.

Being good at mathematics, Blue Mary has made a strategy, to decide when to and when not to repair the door, in order to minimize her expense.

Please write a program to calculate the expectation of her expense.
