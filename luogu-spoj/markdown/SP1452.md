# CAKE - Birthday Cake

## 题目描述

Adolf wants to send a cake to Blue Mary to celebrate her birthday. The cake looks like a tower which has M floors, each floor is a cylinder. The i-th cylinder counted from downside to upside has a integer height h $ _{i} $ and a integer radius r $ _{i} $ . These numbers fulfill the following two conditions:

- h $ _{1} $ > h $ _{2} $ > h $ _{3} $ > ... > h $ _{M} $

- r $ _{1} $ > r $ _{2} $ > r $ _{3} $ > ... > r $ _{M} $

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The very first line contains a integer number T. T test cases follow.

For each test case, the first line contains a single integer number N (N<=10000), the second line contains a single integer number M (M<=10). The cake must be made of M cylinders and its volume must be N\*Pi (Pi = acos(-1.0)).

### 输出格式

For each test case, a single line containing a single integer S must be written to output. The required minimum area must be S\*Pi.
