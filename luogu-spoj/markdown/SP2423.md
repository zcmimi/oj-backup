# MINTRIAN - Minimal Triangulations of Graphs

## 题目描述

Check whether the given graph is [chordal](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChordalGraph.html).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer 1<=t<=200 denoting the number of test cases. Then t graphs are given (not necessarily connected). Each graph is described by two lines. The first line contains a string of the form: n=nodes,m=edges: The second line gives the edges of the graph separated by commas. Each edge is given as a pair of vertices: {u,v}. Vertices of the graph are denoted with integers 0...,n-1.

### 输出格式

For each test case print YES if the graph is chordal, or NO if it isn't.
