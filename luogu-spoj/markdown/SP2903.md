# TRANSP1 - Transportation

## 题目描述

Blue Mary, the queen of Protoss, is planning a war against Zerg. Before the war she plans to make her base as safe as possible. Now there are _N_ (1<= _N_ <= 60) nexuses available in the region controlled by Protoss, numbered 1, 2, ..., _N_. (Those who don't know what nexus is, please visit [Blizzard Entertainment](http://www.blizzard.com).) All the mineral and vespene gas stored in nexus _i_ can be transported directly to nexus _S $ _{i} $_ .(_i_ and _S $ _{i} $_ won't be the same.) Blue Mary's base is nexus 1, So all the mineral and vespene gas can be transported to base 1 directly or indirectly.

Blue Mary defines the safety of nexus _i_, **R(i)**, as the following:

_C $ _{i} $_ and _k_ are numeral constants which will be given in the input file.

Suppose for a fixed _i_, set T={P $ _{1} $ , P $ _{2} $ , P $ _{3} $ , ..., P $ _{w} $ }, then **x** is a member of T if and only if S $ _{x} $ is _i_. Any two P $ _{j} $ s must be different.

Now Blue Mary wants to modify at most _M_ (0<= _M_ <= _N_) _S $ _{i} $_ s, so that the safety of her base **R(1)** is maximized. To be a terran captive, also a great programmer, you must help her to solve this problem. Price is your life. Be careful! Blue Mary tells you that _S $ _{1} $_ can't be modified. Don't ask your queen about the reason please.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Ten test cases(given one after another, you have to process all!). For each test case:

The first line contains _N_, _M_ and a real number _k_ (0.3<= _k_ <1). The second line contains _N_ space seperated integers _S $ _{i} $_ . The third line contains _N_ positive real numbers _C $ _{i} $_ .

There is a single blank line between consecutive test cases.

### 输出格式

For each test case:

A single line - the maximized safety of nexus 1, rounded to two decimal places.
