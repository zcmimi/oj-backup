# IITWPC4D - Arrangement Validity

## 题目描述

n persons are standing in a line. Height of each person is between 1 and n and height of each person is distinct.

You a given array A where A\[i\] denotes how many persons are before i\_th person having heights greater than H\[i\]. eg. For person 2, person 1 is considered before him. If A is given to be \[0, 1\] then one valid arrangements of height could be \[2, 1\] as number of persons having height > 1 before 2 are 1 because H\[1\] > H\[2\]

You have to find out whether this array can be valid for some arrangement of persons. If you can uniquely do so, then find out the array H. Otherwise output -1.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains T : number of test cases. (1 <= T <= 20).

For each test First line contains an integer n. ( 1 <= n <= 10^5)

Next line contains n space seperated integers denoting A\[i\]. (0 <= A\[i\] <= n)

### 输出格式

For each test case output single line

If there is a unique way of H. Then print n space seprated integers in the line.

Otherwise output -1.

In starting of each test case also put "Test : testNumber" (without quotes). Note that there is a space before colon and one space after colon.
