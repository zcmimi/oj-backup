# FUNAREA - Funny Areas

## 题目描述

There is an M x N matrix of integer numbers. Both the rows and columns of the matrix are numbered starting at 0 and ending at M-1 and N-1 respectively.

A funny area is defined by three integers i,j, and r, and it is composed for those cells \[x,y\] such that |i-x| + |j-y| <= r. As you might have probably guessed **\[i,j\]** is the center and **r** is the radius of the funny area.

In this problem we are interested in finding the sum of every cell inside some given funny areas.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers 1 <= M, N <= 1000 representing the rows and columns of the matrix.

Each of the following M lines contains N integers separated by single spaces. These numbers are non-negative and not greater than 1,000,000,000

The next line contains a number F (1 <= F <= 100,000) which is the number of funny areas.

Each of the following F lines contains three integers **i**,**j**, and **r** representing the center and the radius of a funny area.

### 输出格式

F lines: for each funny area print a single number -- the sum of all the cells inside of it.
