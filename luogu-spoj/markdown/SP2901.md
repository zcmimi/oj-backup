### 输入格式

 The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=300). In each of the next t lines there are three integers b, c and d (0 <= b, c and d <= 10 $ ^{200} $ ; b,d < c) separated by a space.

### 输出格式

 For every test case print the length of the segment a, one number per line.
