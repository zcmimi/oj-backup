# SHOP2 - Shopping II

## 题目描述

Karl is going to spend his holiday in Nothingland. Since there is nothing there, he has to buy all supplies now. At the moment, he is waiting at the checkout counter with a shopping cart full of stuff.

Of course, he has a sufficient amount of money in his wallet. However, he prefers to use alternate means of payment if possible: luncheon vouchers, gift certificates, different types of coupons, etc. What makes the matter complicated is that the use of these items is often limited: e.g., luncheon vouchers can only be used to buy food, and gift certificates are often limited to a certain type of gifts.
