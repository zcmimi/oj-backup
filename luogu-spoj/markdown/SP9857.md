# EIGHT - Eight Directions Crossword

## 题目描述

What is an Eight Directions Crossword? It's a filled crossword in which all the words are hidden in eight directions (up, down, left and right and also up-left, down-right etc.) You have to find these hidden words in each crossword.

Đuro has made an N x N eight-directions-crossword. His crossword is a bit strange: you are given only one word and you have to find it in a crossword. To make things more difficult, you can skip some letters in the crossword while looking for the given word. More precisely, the given word is the subsequence of not necesarily consecutive letters in a row, column or a diagonal of the crossword in one of the eight directions.

Now you discover that, under these conditions, you can read the given word in the crossword in multiple ways. How many?
