# PLUSEVI - How Many Plusses

## 题目描述

Mirko is a strange boy so he has written down a square matrix full of ones and zeroes. Now he is interested in how many plusses there are in his matrix.

A plus is a square such that its side has an odd length greater than 1 and all of its cells are zero, except for the middle row and the middle column: they must be full of ones. For example, in the matrix below there are two plusses, one inside the other:

00100

00100

11111

00100

00100
