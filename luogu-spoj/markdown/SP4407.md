# DAGCNT - Counting Arborescence

## 题目描述

_"In graph theory, an arborescence is a directed graph in which, for a vertex v called the root and any other vertex u, there is exactly one directed path from v to u. In other words, an arborescence is a directed, rooted tree in which all edges point away from the root. Every arborescence is a directed acyclic graph."_

\-- from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

You are given a directed graph with _N_ vertices, and your task is to count the number of different arborescences of size _N_ that can be found in the given graph.

Two arborescences are considered different when they consist of different edges.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input consists of multiple test cases.

For each test case, the first line contains one integer _N_ described as above.

N lines follows, each consists of _N_ characters, either '0' or '1', representing the adjacency matrix of the graph.

The directed graph contains edge (_i_,_j_) if and only if the _j_th character of the _i_th line of the matrix is '1'.

The graph consists of no more than 8 vertices.

End of input is indicated by a line consisting of a single 0.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output one line consisting of one single integer, the number of arborescences.
