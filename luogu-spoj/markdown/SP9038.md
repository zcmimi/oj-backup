# BISHOP2 - Chessboard Billiard

## 题目描述

Let's imagine: there is a chess piece billiard ball. Its movements resemble the ones of a bishop chess piece. The only difference is that when a billiard ball hits the board's border, it can reflect from it and continue moving.

More formally, first one of four diagonal directions is chosen and the billiard ball moves in that direction. When it reaches the square located on the board's edge, the billiard ball reflects from it; it changes the direction of its movement by 90 degrees and continues moving. Specifically, having reached a corner square, the billiard ball is reflected twice and starts to move the opposite way. While it moves, the billiard ball can make an infinite number of reflections. At any square of its trajectory the billiard ball can stop and on that the move is considered completed.

You are suggested to find the maximal number of billiard balls, that pairwise do not beat each other and that can be positioned on a chessboard _n_ × _m_ in size.
