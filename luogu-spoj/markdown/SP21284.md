# EMTY3 - Can You Make It Empty 3

## 题目描述

Let us introduce an algorithm with a function **CanEmpty()** which takes a string P as a parameter and return **TRUE** if it is possible to make P empty, otherwise return **FALSE**.

String P consists of only 0 and 1. The pseudo-code implementation of **CanEmpty()** function is as follows.

bool **CanEmpty(**String P**)**

{

while(P has at least one substring 100)

{

Chose any one substring 100 in P and delete it.

}

if(P is empty) return **TRUE**;

else return **FALSE**;

}

Now you are given a string S consisting of 0 and 1, you have to find the length of longest substring of **S** that can be made empty applying **CanEmpty()** algorithm.

As for example, let S=101**110000**0**100**

S has only two sub-strings (bold) which can be made empty applying **CanEmpty()** algorithm.

The first substring will have the delete- sequence in **CanEmpty()** function :

110000->100->empty

The second substring will have the delete-sequence in **CanEmpty()** function:

100->empty

**The length of first substring is 6 and second is 3. So, the required answer is 6.**

**Input**

Input starts with an integer **T (, denoting the number of test cases.**

Each case contains a string S. The size of string is at most **200000**.

**Output**

For each test case, print the case number and required answer.

**Sample Input**

**Output for Sample Input**

2

1011100000100

111011

Case 1: 6

Case 2: 0
