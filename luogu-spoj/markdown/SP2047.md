# REMGAME - Stone Removing Game

## 题目描述

 Consider the following game. The game is played on a 5 x 5 board. Initially every array cell has a piece in it. Two players remove pieces alternatively from the board. The player can remove any number of consecutive pieces in a row or column. For example, in the configuration depicted below where one indicates a piece, the player can either remove one piece (**A1**, **A2**, or **B1**), or remove two pieces (**A1** and **A2**, or **A1** and **B1**) simultaneously. The game ends when one player is forced to take the last piece, and the other player wins the game.

**1** **2** **3** **4** **5** **A** 1 1 0 0 0 **B** 1 0 0 0 0 **C** 0 0 0 0 0 **D** 0 0 0 0 0 **E** 0 0 0 0 0
