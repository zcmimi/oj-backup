# RAINBOW2 - Rainbow

## 题目描述

This time Blue Mary continues doing meaningless calculations! (see problem [SPY](http://www.spoj.com/problems/SPY2)) She is interested in calculating the **K**-th power of a very large **N**x**N** matrix A, where

A $ _{i,j} $ = i \* **D** + **Q** $ ^{j} $

i and j are 0-based index of the row and column of element A $ _{i,j} $ , respectively.

Now she needs your help (again).

To keep the output small, you are only asked to output some of its elements.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Multiple test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 5 space-separated integers **N**, **K**, **D**, **Q**, **M** in this order. **M** lines follow, each contains two space-separated integers **R $ _{i} $** and **C $ _{i} $** .

Input terminates by EOF.

All input numbers are non-negative integers and no more than 10 $ ^{9} $ .(**D**, **R $ _{i} $** and **C $ _{i} $** may be 0, others must be positive integers.) **N** and **M** will be no more than 10 $ ^{5} $ . **R $ _{i} $** and **C $ _{i} $** will be less than **N**.

Input is almost uniformly-random generated, and the number of "large" test cases is relatively small.

### 输出格式

For each test case output exactly **M** lines. Each line contains only one integer: The number at the **R $ _{i} $** -th row and **C $ _{i} $** -th column (0-based) of the matrix **A $ ^{K} $** . As the result may be quite large, output it modulo 10 $ ^{9} $ +2015.
