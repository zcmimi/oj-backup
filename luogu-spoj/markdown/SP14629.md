# HAP01 - Play with Binary Numbers

## 题目描述

Let S be the binary representation of an Integer. We define two functions a(i) and b(i) such that

a(i) = Number of occurrences of '1' at odd positions of S.

b(i) = Number of occurrences of '1' at even positions of S.

For example: for integer 19, S=10011.

so, a(19)=2 and b(19)=1

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains an integer T. T=Number of test cases. Then T lines follow

On each line, you will be given three integers M,N,K.

### 输出格式

For each test case output a single integer R.

Where, R is the number of integers 'i' between M and N(both inclusive) such that absolute difference of a(i) and b(i) is equal to K.

Answer of each each test case should be on separate line
