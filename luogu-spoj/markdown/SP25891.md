# PCLNMBR - Peculiar Number

## 题目描述

Ajoy has got some spare time today. He is using this spare time to think of a particular kind of number.

He calls it ‘Peculiar Number’.

A peculiar number is define by three integers A, B and C and has the following characteristics.

1) If a number is a multiple of A but not a multiple of B then it is a peculiar number.

2) If a number is a multiple of both A and B then it will be a peculiar number only if it is also a multiple of number C. Otherwise it is not a peculiar number.

Now, Ajoy is trying to find the Nth peculiar number for a fixed A, B and C.

But Ajoy does not have all day. So he needs your help to solve the problem.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of the input contains four integers A, B, C and M where (1 <= A, B, C <= 10 $ ^{3} $ ) and (1 <= M <= 10 $ ^{5} $ ) contraints hold.

M denotes the number of queries.

Each of the next M line contains an integer N (1 <= N <= 10 $ ^{9} $ ).

### 输出格式

For each query, print the Nth peculiar number.
