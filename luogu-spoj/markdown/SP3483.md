# BEGIN - Begin

## 题目描述

Begin a sequence of distinct natural numbers Ni , i = 0, 1, 2,... , with the number B (= N0) ; generate numbers Ni , i = 1, 2,... , recursively and end the sequence with the last generated number E . The characteristic of numbers and the process for generation are stated below:

\* Each number in the sequence contains an even number of decimal digits and is of the form f1d1f2d2fk...dk where d1, d2,..., dk , are k distinct digits in increasing order and each fj is a non-zero digit.

\* For i = 0, 1, 2,... , if Ni = f1d1f2d2...fkdk then Ni+1 = F1D1F2D2...FKDK , where K$ \\ge$k ; D1, D2,..., DK , are distinct digits that occur in Ni and appear in increasing order in Ni+1 ; and FJ is the frequency of DJ in Ni , for J = 1, 2,..., K . For example if Ni = 102335 then Ni+1 = 1011122315 .

Write a program to find for a given E , the longest sequence of numbers that ends with E and begins with the smallest B .

Again consider an example; if E =1011122315 then the required sequence of numbers is 303355 103325 1011122315.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input may contain multiple test cases.

Each test case contains only one input, viz., E .

The input terminates when a line containing 0 appears as a test case.

### 输出格式

 For each test case, print the longest sequence of numbers that ends with E and begins with the smallest B . Use space to separate two consecutive numbers in the sequence.
