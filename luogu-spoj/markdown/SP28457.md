## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There are multiple test cases in the input file. The first line contains two integer numbers **N** and **M**, representing the number of subjects in her degree and the number of correlation relations between pairs of subjects, respectively (**1** ****N,M ). The subjects are numbered from **1** to **N**. Each of the following **M** lines contains two integer numbers **A** and **B**, indicating that subject **A** is a correlation subject for subject **B** (**1** ****A, B** ****N** with **A ≠ B**). This means that subject **A** must be registered in the electronic system before subject **B** can be registered. There are no repeated or cyclic correlation relations in the input. The last line contains **N** integer numbers **P $ _{1} $ , P $ _{2} $ , ..., P $ _{N} $** , representing the subjects in the order Gabina will pass them (**1** ****P $ _{i} $** ****N** for **i = 1, ..., N**, with **P $ _{i} $ ≠ P $ _{j} $** for **i ≠ j**).************

### 输出格式

For each test case, print **N** lines, each with a single integer number. The number printed in the **i**-th line represents the number of subjects registered in the electronic system immediately after Gabina passes the **i**-th subject for her degree in the order giver in the input.
