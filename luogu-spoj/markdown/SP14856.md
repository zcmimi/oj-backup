His shop always remains over-crowded as he gives some weird and crazy offers almost every day. Most of the offers favor Customers. He recently created a special offer for his customers. For each item he sells, he gives a special card. These cards are rare and only available in his shop. And no one can cheat with him showing fake cards as he is really good at checking cards. Suppose, a Customer bought **X** items, he gives a positive number **N** along with **X** cards to the customer.
