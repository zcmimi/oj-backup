X moves first. In a move, a player must place an L-triomino (shown on the right), in any of the 4 possible orientations, on the board. The piece placed must not overlap with a piece that has already been placed. The player that is unable to make a valid move loses.

Given the size of the board, find out who will win the game assuming that both X and Y play optimally
