Shuffling the pixels in a bitmap image sometimes yields random looking images. However, by repeating the shuffling enough times, one finally recovers the original images. This should be no surprise, since "shuffling" means applying a one-to-one mapping (or permutation) over the cells of the image, which come in finite number.

Your program should read a number n , and a series of elementary transformations that define a "shuffling" ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2161/598fb30f65716b2690333cbde24b47b998008bf8.png) of n \* n images. Then, your program should compute the minimal number m (m > 0) , such that m applications of ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2161/598fb30f65716b2690333cbde24b47b998008bf8.png) always yield the original n \* n image.

For instance if ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2161/598fb30f65716b2690333cbde24b47b998008bf8.png) is counter-clockwise 90 $ ^{o} $ rotation then m = 4.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Test cases are given one after another, and a single 0 denotes the end of the input. For each test case:

Input is made of two lines, the first line is number n (2 <= n <= 2 $ ^{10} $ , n even). The number n is the size of images, one image is represented internally by a n \* n pixel matrix (a $ ^{j} $ $ _{i} $ ) , where i is the row number and j is the column number. The pixel at the upper left corner is at row 0 and column 0.

The second line is a non-empty list of at most 32 words, separated by spaces. Valid words are the keywords **id**, **rot**, **sym**, **bhsym**, **bvsym**, **div** and **mix**, or a keyword followed by **-**. Each keyword **key** designates an elementary transform (as defined by Figure 1), and **key-** designates the inverse of transform **key**. For instance, **rot-** is the inverse of counter-clockwise 90 $ ^{o} $ rotation, that is clockwise 90 $ ^{o} $ rotation. Finally, the list k $ _{1} $ , k $ _{2} $ , ..., k $ _{p} $ designates the compound transform ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2161/598fb30f65716b2690333cbde24b47b998008bf8.png) = k $ _{1} $ ok $ _{2} $ o ... ok $ _{p} $ . For instance, "bvsym rot-" is the transform that first performs clockwise 90o rotation and then vertical symmetry on the lower half of the image.

### 输出格式

For each test case:

Your program should output a single line whose contents is the minimal number m (m > 0) such that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP2161/598fb30f65716b2690333cbde24b47b998008bf8.png) is the identity. You may assume that, for all test input, you have m < 2 $ ^{31} $ .
