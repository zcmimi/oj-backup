## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line will contain T (1 <= T <= 10), the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of first line N, number of vectors. Next line will contain N (1 <= N <= 1000) vectors of the form of a b -1000<=a,b<=1000.

### 输出格式

You have to print, in a new line for every test case, “YES” if any 3 vectors among N form a triangle, “NO” otherwise.
