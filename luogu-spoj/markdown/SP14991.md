# EGCJPURE - Your Rank is Pure (EXTREME ver)

## 题目描述

Note: The problem description is same as [GCJPURE](../GCJPURE/ "GCJPURE"), but with more higher constraints (to become more challenging), more strict time limit (to reject bad complexity), and more strict source limit (to reject hardcoded precomputation). Good Luck.
