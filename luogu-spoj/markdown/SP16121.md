# NITK06 - MODIFY SEQUENCE

## 题目描述

Suppose we have a sequence of non-negative integers, Namely a $ _{1} $ , a $ _{2} $ , ..., a $ _{n} $ . At each time we can choose one term a $ _{i} $ with 0 < i < n and we subtract 1 from both a $ _{i} $ and a $ _{i+1} $ . We wonder whether we can get a sequence of all zeros after several operations.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line is the number of test cases T (0 < T <= 20).

The first line of each test case is a number N (0 < N <= 10000). The next line is N non-negative integers, 0 <= a $ _{i} $ <= 10 $ ^{9} $ .

### 输出格式

If it can be modified into all zeros with several operations output “YES” in a single line, otherwise output “NO” instead.
