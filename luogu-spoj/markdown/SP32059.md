# ADATAXES - Ada and Taxes

## 题意翻译

该农民的蔬菜中有一部分要交税

征收的税金为：所有蔬菜高度之积

由于税金极有可能很高，所以如果税大于1000000007（10^9+7），就只要交出1000000007元，剩下的自己留着

你的工作是：算出那农民Ada在税金中，还能剩下多少钱

## 题目描述

 As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows vegetables in a long furrow. All of the vegetables have some height. Local politicians tax small vegetables, but as the furrow is very long, they always tax just a part of it.

The taxes always have some limit on height. They are calculated very simply: Tax collectors multiply the heights of all vegetables, which are lesser or equal to limit and are on desired segment.

The taxes might be very high so tax collectors just round their income and take only **1000000007** (**10 $ ^{9} $ +7**) banknotes. They are very kind, so they always leave the rest to Ada. She is interested in how much they will leave her.

**NOTE:** If none of the vegeteble is lesser/equal to given limit, Ada is left with symbolical 1 "money".
