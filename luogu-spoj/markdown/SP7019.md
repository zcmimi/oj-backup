There is a rabbit in the cell containing number 1. A rabbit can jump to a neighboring cell (up, down, left or right) if that cell exists.

Given K valid rabbit jumps, write a program that will calculate the sum of numbers of all cells that rabbit visited (add the number to the sum each time rabbit visits the same cell).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers N and K (1 000, 1 000), the size of the matrix and the number of rabbit jumps.

The second line contains a sequence of K characters 'U', 'D', 'L' and 'R', describing the direction of each jump. The sequence of jumps will not leave the matrix at any moment.

### 输出格式

Output one integer, the sum of numbers on visited cells.

**Note:** This number doesn't always fit in 32-bit integer type.
