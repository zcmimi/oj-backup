# SUMITR - Sums in a Triangle

## 题目描述

 Let us consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:

- on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right;

- the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100;

- all numbers are positive integers between O and 99.

Take care about your fingers, do not use more than **256** bytes of code.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.

### 输出格式

 For each test case write the determined value in a separate line.
