# ELCS - Easy Longest Common Substring

## 题目描述

In this problem, a string only consists of lowercase letters.

Substring, is a consecutive sequence of characters occurrences at least once in a string.

Common substring means a substring of two strings.

After getting TLE on LCS and LCS2, lqp18\_31 felt really depressed. So he came up with an interesting idea. He want to modify the definition of LCS and call it ELCS.

ELCS: for two given strings s1\[0…n-1\] and s2\[0…m-1\], the ELCS of them is a string p\[0…k-1\] k<=min(n,m) so that s1\[i\]=s2\[i\]=p\[i\] ( for 0<=i<k ) and s1\[k\]!=s2\[k\] or k==n or k==m . Now your task is easy. You are given N strings and Q queries. Each query consists two intergers a and b. You must answer the length of the ELCS of the a-th string and b-th string.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Firtst line consists one interger N.

Next N lines consist N strings.

Next one line consists one interger Q.

Next Q lines consist two intergers a and b. (0<=a,b<N) 30% of the testdata : N<=100 Q<=10000 length(string\[i\])<=100 100% of the testdata : the number of total characters<=500000 N<=100000 Q<=100000

### 输出格式

Q lines. Each line consists the length of the ELCS of the a-th string and b-th string
