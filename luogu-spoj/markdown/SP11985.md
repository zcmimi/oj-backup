# GOT - Gao on a tree

## 题意翻译

题目大意：给你一棵树，每个点有点权，询问点a到点b的路径中是否有点的点权为c

## 题目描述

 There's a tree, with each vertex assigned a number. For each query (a, b, c), you are asked whether there is a vertex on the path from a to b, which is assigned number c?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

There are multiple cases, end by EOF.

For each case, the first line contains n (n <= 100000) and m (m <= 200000), representing the number of vertexes (numbered from 1 to n) and the number of queries.

Then n integers follows, representing the number assigned to the i-th vertex.

Then n-1 lines, each of which contains a edge of the tree.

Then m lines, each of which contains three integers a, b and c (0 <= c <= n), representing a query.

### 输出格式

You should output "`Find`" or "`NotFind`" for every query on one line.

Output a blank line AFTER every case.
