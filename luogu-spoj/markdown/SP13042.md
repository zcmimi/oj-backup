# AMR12B - Gandalf vs the Balrog

## 题目描述

'We fought far under the living earth, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels. Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame. Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire.' - Gandalf, describing his fight against the Balrog.
