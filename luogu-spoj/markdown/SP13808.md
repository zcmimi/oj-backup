# COLOR_CC - Colors

## 题目描述

Given a Bipartite graph with N nodes, you have to colour each node in a way such that no two adjacent nodes have the same colour . Each node is allowed to choose colour from a subset of colours. print the possible number of ways.

You are given a symmetric matrix i.e. matrix\[i\]\[j\] is always equal to matrix\[j\]\[i\]

if matrix\[i\]\[j\]=='Y' then nodes i and j are connected by an edge matrix\[i\]\[j\]=='N' then nodes i and j are not connected

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

T -number of test cases ( N test cases follow )

N -number of nodes in graph . N lines corresponding to matrix

N line follows : each line contains xi -- total colours ith node can take , followed by i colours

### 输出格式

Print the possible number of ways to colour the graph

T would be less than 20

0<= N <= 13

size of matrix will be N\*N

each element of matrix would be either 'Y' or 'N'

number of colours a node can take would be greater then equal to 0 and less than equal to 8 colour number would be less than 100000
