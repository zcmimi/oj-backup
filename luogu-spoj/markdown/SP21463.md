# NPC2014H - Arithmetic Rectangle

## 题目描述

There is a matrix with size N x M where each cell contains an integer. An arithmetic rectangle is a rectangle inside the matrix so that each row and column is an arithmetic progression. An arithmetic progression is a sequence so that each number minus the number before it is the same. Given a matrix, find the largest arithmetic rectangle, which is the arithmetic rectangle containing the most number of cells. For example, the largest arithmetic rectangles of the matrix below consists of 9 cells:
