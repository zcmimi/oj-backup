# PSYCHOT - Psycho34 (easy)

## 题目描述

 In the prime factorization of a number **_N_**, there's two kinds of powers. Even powers, in red, are psychotic ones, and odd powers, in blue, are ordinary ones. We'll say **_N_** a **Psycho** number if the count of even powers is strictly greater than the count of odd powers, else an **Ordinary** number. For example, if **_N_ = 67500** with prime factorization 67500 = 2 $ ^{2} $ x 3 $ ^{3} $ x 5 $ ^{4} $ . This number have 2 even powers and 1 odd power. Since 2>1, so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.
