# MPOINT - Point Visible

## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MPOINT/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MPOINT/vn/) ```

N points are given in a plane. Any point has integer coordinates and no

two points have the same x coordinates or the same y coordinates.

A pair of points A and B uniquely define a rectangle R(A,B) whose sides

are parallel to coordinate axes such that the points A and B are endpoints

of one of its diagonals. A pair of two given points A and B are very visible

if there are no other given points within a rectangle R(A,B). A pair of points

consists of two different points and in this problem pairs (A,B) and (B,A)

are regarded to be the same pair and are counted as one pair.

At the beginning a coordinate plane has no given points. Your program should read

coordinates of the given points and after reading coordinates of a point,

it should write number of pairs of currently very visible given points.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

```

First line of input contains an integer N, 2 ≤ N ≤ 5000, the number of given

points.

Each of the following N lines contains two integers X, Y, 0 ≤ X,Y ≤ 10^6,

coordinates of the given points in the order they should be added to the plane.

```

### 输出格式

```

An output should contain N lines, kth line should contain a number

of pairs of very visible given points after taking kth

given point into account.
