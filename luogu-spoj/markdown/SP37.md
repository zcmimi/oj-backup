# PROPKEY - The Proper Key

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

许多人认为俄罗斯方块是由两位俄罗斯程序员发明的，然而这并不是真正事实。 游戏的主意出现得很早——甚至可以追溯到埃及。 不过他们并不是把它当作一个游戏。 相反，它被用作复杂的锁。 锁是由木头制成的，其中有许多的正方形区块，这些区块按照行和列来排列。 每个区块要么是被填充上木块，要么是空的。 这个锁的密钥是平面的，它能够插入锁中的空格区域。 相当于有一个平面锁和平面密钥，密钥可以从顶部插入到锁。但密钥不能向上移动，它只能下降和左右滑动——与俄罗斯方块游戏一样。 唯一的区别在于密钥不能旋转， 而俄罗斯方块的旋转确实是俄罗斯发明。

金字塔的入口就有这样的锁。 $ACM$ 的考古学家发现了几把密钥，很有可能有其中一个是可以开锁的。现在他们需要试一下，然后找出哪个能用。 把每个密钥试一遍太耗时，所以最好先从那些能被插入更深的密钥开始。 请设计一个程序确定给定的密钥是否可以插入给定的锁。

## 输入输出格式

** 输入格式： **

输入由 $T$ 组数据组成。

输入文件的第一行上给出密钥的数目 $T$ 。

每个测试样例都占若干行，

第一行包含两个整数 $R$ 和 $C$ $ (1<=R$,$C<=100)$ ，表示密钥大小。

然后是 $R$ 行，每个行都包含 $C$ 字符。每个字符要么是(``#``)，要么是(``.``)。

``#``表示一个正方形木块；``.``表示一个空格子。

木块总是连在一起的。也就是说，整把密钥是由一组连接的木块构成的。

此外，即使我们从顶部切断任意行的木块，密钥仍然是连接的。 在最上、最下、最左和最右的列中，总是至少有一个非空区块。

在输入密钥后，再输入一行，包含两个整数 $D$ 和 $W$ $(1<=D<=10000$，$1<=W<=1000)$。 $W$ 是锁的宽度，$D$ 是它的深度。 接下来的D行，每行包含W个字符。 字符可以是(``#``)（代表木块），也可以是(``.``)(空格子)（同上）。

**输出格式：**

每个测试样例输出一行。 每行输出"``The key falls to depth X.``"，即密钥最多下降x深度（若能穿过整个锁，则输出“``The key can fall through.``”）。 左右移动密钥插入锁中，深度 $x$ 即为密钥的底部和锁的顶部之间的距离。

## 说明

**注意：输入数据较大。**

## 题目描述

 Many people think that Tetris was invented by two Russian programmers. But that is not the whole truth. The idea of the game is very old -- even the Egyptians had something similar. But they did not use it as a game. Instead, it was used as a very complicated lock. The lock was made of wood and consisted of a large number of square fields, laid out in regular rows and columns. Each field was either completely filled with wood, or empty. The key for this lock was two-dimensional and it was made by joining square parts of the same size as the fields of the lock. So they had a 2D lock and 2D key that could be inserted into the lock from the top. The key was designed so that it was not possible to move it upwards. It could only fall down and it could slide sideways -- exactly like in a Tetris game. The only difference is that the key could not be rotated. Rotation in Tetris is really a Russian invention.

The entry gate into the Pyramid has such a lock. The ACM archaeologists have found several keys and one of them belongs to the lock with a very high probability. Now they need to try them out and find which one to use. Because it is too time-consuming to try all of them, it is better to begin with those keys that may be inserted deeper into the lock. Your program should be able to determine how deep a given key can be inserted into a given lock.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of T test cases. The number of them (T) is given on the first line of the input file. Each test case begins with a line containing two integers R and C (1 <= R,C <= 100) indicating the key size. Then exactly R rows follow, each containing C characters. Each character is either a hash mark (`#`) or a period (`.`). A hash mark represents one square field made of wood; a period is an empty field. The wooden fields are always connected, i.e. the whole key is made of one piece. Moreover, the key remains connected even if we cut off arbitrary number of rows from its top. There is always at least one non-empty field in the top-most and bottom-most rows and the left-most and right-most columns.

After the key description, there is a line containing two integers D and W (1 <= D <= 10000, 1 <= W <= 1000). The number W is the lock width, and D is its depth. The next D lines contain W characters each. The character may be either a hash mark (representing the wood) or a period (the free space).

### 输出格式

Your program should print one line of output for each test case. The line should contain the statement "`The key falls to depth X.`". Replace X with the maximum depth to which the key can be inserted by moving it down and sliding it to the left or right only. The depth is measured as the distance between the bottom side of the key and the top side of the lock. If it is possible to move the key through the whole lock and take it away at the bottom side, output the sentence "`The key can fall through.`".
