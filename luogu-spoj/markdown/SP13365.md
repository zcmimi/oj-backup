# BOULDER - Move the boulder

## 题目描述

A huge boulder is somehow blocking a public square. The citizens, each one of them approaching from his/her street, decide to remove it. Each citizen can try to either push the boulder away from him, pull it towards him, or choose to do nothing. (note that the citizens cannot change their direction relative to the boulder). Obviously, they want to remove the boulder as quickly as possible - in other words, they want to maximise the magnitude of the net force they apply. Tell them what this maximum possible magnitude is.
