# AREA1 - Circle vs Triangle

## 题目描述

You are given a triangle and a circle in a plane. You can arbitrarily rotate or move them. What's the maximum possible area of their overlapping region?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input consists of one or more lines. For each line, there are four integers describing one test case: the lengths of three sides of a triangle _a_, _b_, _c_; and the radius of a circle _r_; where 1<= _a_ <= _b_ <= _c_ <= 100, 1<= _r_ c_ .

End of input is indicated by a line consisting four zeros.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output a single line showing the largest overlapping area of the circle and the triangle. We accept solutions with absolute error less than 10 $ ^{-2} $ .
