# ADVEDIST - Advanced Edit Distance

## 题目描述

The edit distance of two strings S and T is the minimum number of edit operations that need to be done to transform S into T . The valid edit operations are:

• Insert a single character at any position.

• Modify an existing character.

• Remove an existing character.

For example, the edit distance of “pantera” and “aorta” is 5, because the following chain of

edits is valid (and there is no shorter chain):

“pantera” >>> “antera” >>> “aotera” >>> “aoera” >>> “aora” >>> “aorta”.

We define the advanced edit distance in a similar way, but adding the swap of two adjacent characters as an extra valid operation. With this setting, the advanced edit distance of “pantera” and “aorta” is 4:

“pantera” >>> “antera” >>> “antra” >>> “aotra” >>> “aorta”.

You need to write a program that calculates the advanced edit distance of two given words.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains

two non-empty words, each of them of at most 1000 lowercase letters, separated by a single

space. The last line of the input contains two asterisks separated by a single space and should

not be processed as a test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case output a single line with an integer representing the advanced edit distance

of the two input words.
