# CALCULAT - Digital Calculator

## 题目描述

Dan likes playing with his pocket calculator during those long, boring math classes. Just now the teacher started to talk about the factorial function.

**N** factorial, denoted by **N!**, is the product of all the integers between 1 and **N**, inclusive. For example 6! = 6\*5\*4\*3\*2\*1 = 720.

Dan took out his calculator out of his pocket to play around with this new function. Unfortunately his calculator quickly ran out of digits and only showed overflow errors. Soon, Dan realized that the factorial function grows very quickly. Still, he would like to know at least some of its digits.
