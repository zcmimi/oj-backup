# PWSUM - Power Sums

## 题目描述

![suma](../../../content/syntax_error:pwsum.png "pwsum")

Everyone knows that we can express sums of form sigma i = 1 to x ( i^k ) as polynomials

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first and only line of input contains a nonnegative integer k ( 0 <= k <= 300 ): the power we use in our sum.

### 输出格式

The first and only line of output should contain the canonic coefficient representation of the formula. To elaborate, this should be the form of your output:

a $ _{k+1} $ x $ ^{k+1} $ + a $ _{k} $ x $ ^{k} $ + a $ _{k-1} $ x $ ^{k-1} $ ... a $ _{0} $ x $ ^{0} $

ai here represents the coefficient that stands by the i-th power of x. As we only wish to find the formula modulo 10007, all the coefficients should be from interval \[0, 10006\] of integers. See the sample input and output for further clarification.
