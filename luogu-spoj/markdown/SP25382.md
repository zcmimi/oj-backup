At last you got lucky. You start working in a large reputable company. Someone appreciate your outstanding abilities and now you have the opportunity to approve oneself. You can't wait for your first task.

You follow the manager who leads you to the hallway full of doors. You get a piece of paper and all you hear from your new supervisor before he disappears in one of the rooms: 'Here's a list of scheduled meetings for the next week. Arrange them so that as many of them took place. "

Can you do that?

Every day is defined as follows: first the number of available rooms **r** (0 < **r** 10 $ ^{5} $ ) and scheduled meetings **m** (0 < **m** < 10 $ ^{6} $ ). Then **m** lines describing the meetings. Single meeting consists of four values: **bh**:**bm**, **eh**:**em** (0 **bh**, **eh** 23, 0 **bm**, **em** 59) which are time (in format: hours: minutes) of the begining and ending. No meeting begins and ends at the same time. The start time is always earlier than the end. Meetings take place within one day (no meetings begin one day and finish the next).
