# HLPRSRCH - Help a researcher

## 题目描述

A scientist was doing a research on some kinds of bacteria. He found that the kinds, he examined, take **T** unit of time to grow (be mature) enough in order to can reproduce.

Also he found that each type reproduces with a constant rate which is **N** new bacteria every **F** unit of time.

(where **F**=**T**)

### Task

write a progam that reads **L** (number of bacteria (at the begining of the experiment)), **M** (number of mature bacteria of them), **T** (time of each to get mature which is also the time needed for reproducing **N** new bacteria), **N** (rate of reproducing per **T** unit of time) and **Z** (period elapsed by the experiment).

Calculate the number of bacteria after **Z** unit of time.Regardless of life-span
