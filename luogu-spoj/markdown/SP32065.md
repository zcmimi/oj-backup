# TACHANKA - Save Lord Tachanka

## 题意翻译

## **题目描述**

我们的朋友塔查卡正在执行一项任务，他必须迅速赶到基地。但是邪恶的敌人偷走了许多轻机枪并把它们架设在塔查卡赶往基地的路上。你需要帮助塔查卡脱身。

假设有一个N×M的方格矩阵，塔查卡在矩阵的左上角(1,1)位置处，他需要赶到矩阵右下角(N,M)处。他只能向下或向右移动，速度为1格/秒。他必须保持移动，因为他不能在任何方格停留。

敌人将K架轻机枪架设在K个特殊的方格内，每一架机枪都有开始开火的时间t和射速f。它会在t时刻第一次射击，随后每f秒(t+f,t+2f...)再射击一次。轻机枪每次射击，都会同时向上下左右四个方向发射一颗子弹，子弹的速度也是1格/秒。

假设一架轻机枪位于(x,y)，它的起始开火时间为t，射速为f。在t时刻，它射出第一组子弹。在t+s时刻，向上发射的子弹位于(x,y+s),向下发射的子弹位于(x,y-s)，向左发射的子弹位于(x-s,y)，向右发射的子弹位于(x+s,y)。在t+f时刻，机枪会再开火。当子弹越过矩阵边界时，它会消失。轻机枪按照1～K的顺序标号。如果两颗来自不同机枪的子弹相遇(位于同一方格)，标号大的机枪发射的子弹会摧毁另一颗并继续飞行。在任意时刻，只要塔查卡和子弹位于同一方格，他会被射杀。

不要紧张，你可以帮助塔查卡。他可以与基地取得联系并汇报一架轻机枪的具体位置，总部会空袭这架机枪并摧毁他。由于现在处于战时，作为指挥官，你要最大化地减少导弹的使用数量。

根据以上条件，计算出塔查卡安全到达基地的最小时间以及为确保他安全所需要摧毁机枪的最小数量。

(题目未给出数据范围)

## **输入输出格式**

**输入格式**

第1行:三个用空格隔开的整数，N，M，K，分别代表矩阵的长，宽和轻机枪的数量。

第2～K+1行:四个整数，前两个数代表轻机枪的坐标(x,y)，后两个代表起始开火时间t和射速f。

**输出格式**

两个整数，分别代表塔查卡到达基地的最小时间和摧毁炮台的最小数量。

## 题目描述

 Our friend Lord Tachanka is on an important mission. He has to reach basecamp quickly. But the evil enemies have stolen many LMG's and have placed them along the way. You'll have to help him out!

Lord Tachanka is initially at the top left corner (1,1) of a rectangular N × M grid. He needs to reach the bottom right corner (N,M). He can only move down or right. He moves at the speed of 1 cell per second. He has to move every second—that is, he cannot stop and wait at any cell.

There are K special cells that contain the LMG planted by the enemies. Each LMG has a starting time t and a frequency f. It first fires at time t seconds, followed by another round at time t+f seconds, then at time t+2f seconds …. When a LMG fires, it simultaneously emits four bullets, one in each of the four directions: up, down, left and right. The pulses travel at 1 cell per second.

Suppose a LMG is located at (x,y) with starting time t and frequency f. At time t seconds, it shoots its first set of bullets. The bullets travelling upwards will be at the cell (x,y-s) at time t+s seconds. At this time, the bullets travelling left will be at cell (x-s,y), the bullets travelling right will be at cell (x+s,y) and the bullets travelling down will be at cell (x,y+s). It will fire next at time t+f seconds. If a bullets crosses an edge of the grid, it disappears. The LMG's are numbered 1 to k, and if two bullets from different LMG's happen to meet, the one coming from the higher numbered LMG survives. At any time, if Lord Tachanka and a bullet are in the same cell, he dies. That is the only way bullet interact with Lord Tachanka.

But don't be worried, as you can help the Lord. He can contact his basecamp and can report them the exact position of an LMG, and it will be destroyed by air support. But the war is going on, and you as a commander will have to ensure that minimum missiles are wasted.

Given these, you should find the least time (in seconds) in which Lord Tachanka can reach his basecamp safely.Also calculate the minimum LMG's that are needed to be destroyed so that the Lord can reach the basecamp safely.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Line 1: Three space separated integers N, M and K, describing the number of rows and columns in the grid and the number of LMG's, respectively.

Lines 2 to K+1: These lines describe the K LMGs. Each line has four space separated integers.

The first two integers on the line denote the row and column where the LMG is located,

the third integer is its starting time, and the fourth integer is its frequency.

The LMG's are numbered in the order in which it appears in the input, i.e from 1 to k

### 输出格式

You need to output two integers, the minimum amount of time required for the Lord to reach the basecamp, and the minimum LMG's needed to be destroyed.
