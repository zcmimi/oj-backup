# ADAFIELD - Ada and Field

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug owns a beautiful field where she grows vegetables. She often visits local Farmers Market, where she buys new seeds. Since two types of vegetable can't share same field, she always divide the field, by either vertical or horizontal line (she is very precise, so the width of line is negligible). Since she visits Farmers Market almost every day, she has already made a lot of such lines, so she needs your help with finding out the area of biggest field.
