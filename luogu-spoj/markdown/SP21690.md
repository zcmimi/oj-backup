## 题目描述

Your younger brother's teacher gave him this simple problem.

Given _b_ and _c_. Evaluate the result of this expression:

_Result_ $ _{1} $ = _b_ $ ^{c} $

Your brother definitely was able to solve this easy problem. So his teacher decided to give him a bit harder problem.

Given _a_,_b_ and _c_. Evaluate the result of this expression:

_Result_ $ _{1} $ = _b_ $ ^{c} $

$ ^{} $ _Result_ $ _{2} $ = _a_ $ ^{Result1} $

However, your brother was also able to solve it. It was not that harder. His teacher was excited -though- and gave him this Bonus Programming Assignment.

Write a program that is given a,b and c; calculates the value of _Result_ $ _{2} $ . Since the output may be exponentially very large, checking the correctness of solutions will be a bit subtle problem. So, instead of printing the whole value of _Result_ $ _{2} $ , just print the reaminder of dividing _Result_ $ _{2} $ by 1,000,000,007 (10 $ ^{9} $ + 7).

Can you help him solve that task?
