# SCIENCE - Science

## 题目描述

Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to Aperture Science. Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians -- you're here because we want the best, and you are it. That said it's time to make some science.

Now I want each of you to stand on one of these buttons. Well done, we're making great progress here. Now let's do it again. Oh come on, don't stand on the same button. Move people! No, no, that button's only for the astronauts, you know who you are. What?! You say you can't do everything I ask. Ok let's start over. You there, the Olympian, figure out how many times we can do this. And make it quick, we have a lot more science to get through.

Each line should contain N integers separated by a space where the ith integer describes who is on the ith button.
