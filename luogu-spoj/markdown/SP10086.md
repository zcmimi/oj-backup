# JMPMNKEY - Jumping Monkey

## 题目描述

You are a hunter chasing a monkey in the forest, trying to shoot it down with your all-powerful automatic machine gun. The monkey is hiding somewhere behind the branches of one of the trees, out of your sight. You can aim at one of the trees and shoot; your bullets are capable of going through the branches and killing the monkey instantly if it happens to be in that tree. If it isn’t, the monkey takes advantage of the time it takes you to reload and takes a leap into a neighbouring tree without you noticing. It never stays in the same place after a shot. You would like to find out whether there is an strategy that allows you to capture the monkey for sure, irrespective of its initial location and subsequent jumps. If so, you need to determine the shortest sequence of shots guaranteeing this.
