## 题目描述

Find the number of strings of length “N” made up of only 3 characters – a, b, c such that “a” occurs at least “min\_a” times and at most “max\_a” times, “b” occurs at least “min\_b” times and at most “max\_b” times and “c” occurs at least “min\_c” times and at most “max\_c” times. Note that all permutations of same string count as 1, so “abc” is same as “bac”.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line gives T, the number of test cases.

Each test case has an integer “N” on first line.

Next line contains 2 integers, min\_a and max\_a.

Next line contains 2 integers, min\_b and max\_b.

Next line contains 2 integers, min\_c and max\_c.

### 输出格式

Output T lines, each containing the required answer modulo 10^9+7.
