## 题目描述

You are on an nxm grid where each square on the grid has a digit on it. From a given square that has digit k on it, a Move consists of jumping exactly k squares in one of the four cardinal directions. A move cannot go beyond the edges of the grid; it does not wrap. What is the minimum number of moves required to get from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner?
