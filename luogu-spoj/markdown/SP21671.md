# JUMPPY - Jumppy and the Grid

## 题目描述

```

Jumppy likes to jump! One day Jumppy went to a park. Jumppy can jump all over the park.The park can be thought of as a square grid with square cells of side length 1. The contents of the grid is either 0(zero) or X. There are certain things which Jumppy likes. They are:->Jumppy likes rectangles.->Jumppy likes X.Therefore Jumppy will jump only in the rectangles consisting of X. A rectangle is defined as follows:1)The whole rectangular region should contain only X.2)The rectangle should be surrounded with 0 or the boundary of the grid.3)The diagonally adjacent cell(see the definition) of the corner of the rectangle may be X or 0.(Refer to the first example).Diagonally adjacent cell: Suppose the given cell has coordinates (p,q) then its diagonally adjacent cells would have coordinates (p+1,q+1) , (p+1,q-1) , (p-1,q+1) , (p-1,q-1).Now Jumppy is curious how many rectangles are there in the park. Help Jumppy find the number of rectangle.INPUT:An integer n denoting the side of the grid.Then n lines follow each containing a string of n characters describing the square grid. All the characters will be either 0 or X.OUTPUT:Output the number of rectangles in the given grid.CONSTRAINTS:0 < n <= 1000EXAMPLES:INPUT:4XX00XX0000XX00XXOUTPUT: 2INPUT:5000000XXX00XXX00XXX000X00OUTPUT: 0INPUT:5000000XXX00X0X00XXX000000OUTPUT:0INPUT:3X0X0X0X0XOUTPUT: 5EXPLANATION: Case 1: As can be seen there are two rectangles as highlighted.Case 2: The grid contains no rectangles because it violets the second condition of definition.Case 3: The grid contains no rectangles because it violets the first condition of definition.Case 4: The individual X in this case can be considered as rectangles.
