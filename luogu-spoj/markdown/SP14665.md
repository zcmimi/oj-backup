# DELTACAT - Delta catheti (hard)

## 题目描述

**(3, 4, 5)** is a famous Pythagorean triple, it gives a quick answer to the question: For a given integer **_d_**, is there a Pythagorean triple **(_a, b, c_)** such that **_b - a = d_**?

A solution is **(3_d_, 4_d_, 5_d_)**, and in fact one can easily prove that the set of solutions is infinite, and that there is an obvious total order on those solutions. Given **_n_**, you'll have to find the **_n_**th term of the sequence of solutions.

Geometrically, it is the study of right triangles for which the difference of the catheti are equal to **_d_**.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains an integer **_T_**, the number of test cases.

Each of the next **_T_** lines contains three integers **_n, d, m_**.

### 输出格式

For each test case, compute the **_n_**th term amongst the solutions **(_a, b, c_)** for the problem : **_a $ ^{2} $ + b $ ^{2} $ = c $ ^{2} $_** with **_b - a = d_** and **_0 < a < b < c_** .

As the answer could not fit in a 64-bit container, simply output your answer modulo **_m_**.
