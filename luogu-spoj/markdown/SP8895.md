# POCRI - Power Crisis

## 题意翻译

描述

有n个机器，每个机器有2个芯片，每个芯片可以放k个电池。

每个芯片能量是k个电池的能量的最小值。

两个芯片的能量之差越小，这个机器就工作的越好。

现在有2nk个电池，已知它们的能量，我们要把它们放在n个机器上的芯片上，

使得所有机器的能量之差的最大值最小。

输入

第一行，两个正整数，n和k。

第二行，2nk个整数，表示每个电池的能量。

输出

一行一个整数，表示所有机器的能量之差的最大值最小是多少。

## 题目描述

During the power crisis in New Zealand this winter (caused by a shortage of rain and hence low levels in the hydro dams), a contingency scheme was developed to turn off the power to areas of the country in a systematic, totally fair, manner. The country was divided up into N regions (Auckland was region number 1, and Wellington number 13). A number, m, would be picked 'at random', and the power would first be turned off in region 1 (clearly the fairest starting point) and then in every m'th region after that, wrapping around to 1 after N, and ignoring regions already turned off. For example, if N = 17 and m = 5, power would be turned off to the regions in the order:1,6,11,16,5,12,2,9,17,10,4,15,14,3,8,13,7.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input will consist of a series of lines, each line containing the number of regions (N) with 13 <= N < 100. The file will be terminated by a line consisting of a single 0.

### 输出格式

Output will consist of a series of lines, one for each line of the input. Each line will consist of the number m according to the above scheme.
