# MONEYYTU - Save money for YTU

## 题目描述

It is Taru’s dream to study in Yanyang Technological University and Taru must start saving money in order to ensure that he has sufficient funds to take admission. Taru needs to have X amount of dollars at the end of T months. Taru deposits his money in a bank that pays a monthly interest of R% on the balance in his account. But wait, Taru is very superstitious; he deposits money in his account only if the balance in the account is a multiple of 100. If the balance in the account at the beginning of a month is not a multiple of 100 Taru withdraws the minimum offset to make the balance divisible by 100 and donates it to a charitable trust.
