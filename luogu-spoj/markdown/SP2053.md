# CERC07K - Key Task

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

有一个二维的迷宫，每一个方格中可能会有墙、可通行的路、门或钥匙。门和钥匙各有四种颜色：蓝色（Blue），黄色（Yellow），红色（Red）和绿色（Green）。一把钥匙只能打开与其颜色相同的门。

注意：你不能对角线移动；不能穿过墙壁；不能走出迷宫的区域；当你碰到一扇门时，手上必须有与其相同颜色的钥匙方可通过。

现在给出迷宫与当前你所处的位置，求出走出迷宫最少需几步。

## 输入输出格式

#### 输入格式

输入若干个组数据，第一行是迷宫的长宽$R$和$C$。紧接着的$R$行，每行包含$C$个字符。下面是字符的种类：

井号$'$#$' $ 表示墙；

点$'.'$ 表示道路；

星号$'*'$ 表示你的起始位置；

大写字母$'B'$，$'Y'$，$'R'$，$'G'$ 分别表示蓝色、黄色、红色和绿色的门；

小写字母$'b'$，$'y'$，$'r'$，$'g'$ 分别表示蓝色、黄色、红色和绿色的钥匙；

大写字母$'X'$ 表示出口。

请注意，数据允许：

- 多个出口

- 没有出口

- 多扇相同颜色的门或多把相同颜色的钥匙

- 没有对应某扇门的钥匙或对应某把钥匙的门

每个迷宫中$'*'$只会出现一次，输入以两个$0$结束。

#### 输出格式

对于每个迷宫，若可以走出，输出"Escape possible in S steps."，句子中的$S$表示最小的步数，否则输出"The poor student is trapped!"。拾取钥匙或打开门不计入步数。

## 题目描述

The Czech Technical University is rather old - you already know that it celebrates 300 years of its existence in 2007. Some of the university buildings are old as well. And the navigation in old buildings can sometimes be a little bit tricky, because of strange long corridors that fork and join at absolutely unexpected places.

The result is that some first-graders have often difficulties finding the right way to their classes. Therefore, the Student Union has developed a computer game to help the students to practice their orientation skills. The goal of the game is to find the way out of a labyrinth. Your task is to write a verification software that solves this game.

The labyrinth is a 2-dimensional grid of squares, each square is either free or filled with a wall. Some of the free squares may contain doors or keys. There are four different types of keys and doors: blue, yellow, red, and green. Each key can open only doors of the same color. You can move between adjacent free squares vertically or horizontally, diagonal movement is not allowed. You may not go across walls and you cannot leave the labyrinth area. If a square contains a door, you may go there only if you have stepped on a square with an appropriate key before.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of several maps. Each map begins with a line containing two integer numbers R and C (1 <= R, C <= 100) specifying the map size. Then there are R lines each containing C characters. Each character is one of the following:

Hash mark '#' Wall

Dot '.' Free square

Asterisk '\*' Your position

Uppercase letter 'B','Y','R','G' Blue, yellow, red or green door

Uppercase X 'X' Exit

Note that it is allowed to have \* more than one exit,

\* no exit at all,

\* more doors and/or keys of the same color, and

\* keys without corresponding doors and vice versa.

You may assume that the marker of your position ("\*") will appear exactly once in every map. There is one blank line after each map. The input is terminated by two zeros in place of the map size.

### 输出格式

For each map, print one line containing the sentence "Escape possible in S steps.", where S is the smallest possible number of step to reach any of the exits. If no exit can be reached, output the string "The poor student is trapped!" instead. One step is defined as a movement between two adjacent cells. Grabbing a key or unlocking a door does not count as a step.
