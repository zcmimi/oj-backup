# APRIME - Anti-prime Sequences

## 题意翻译

输入n,m,d,已知一段由n到m中的所有数组成的序列,你可以将这段序列重新排序。

现在要求你将这段序列排序,满足:任意从中选取一段连续的d个数字,它们的和都必须为合数。

求满足要求的序列,若有这样的序列,请输出字典序最小的那一串;否则输出"No anti-prime sequence exists."。

## 题目描述

Given a sequence of consecutive integers n, n+1, n+2,..., m, an anti-prime sequence is a rearrangement of these integers so that each adjacent pair of integers sums to a composite (non-prime) number. For example, if n = 1 and m = 10, one such anti-prime sequence is 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 6, 9, 7, 8, 10. This is also the lexicographically first such sequence.

We can extend the definition by defining a degree d anti-prime sequence as one where all consecutive subsequences of length 2, 3,..., d sum to a composite number. The sequence above is a degree 2 anti-prime sequence, but not a degree 3, since the subsequence 5, 4, 2 sums to 11. The lexicographically first degree 3 anti-prime sequence for these numbers is 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 10, 8, 7, 9.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input will consist of multiple input sets. Each set will consist of three integers, n, m, and d on a single line. The values of n, m and d will satisfy 1 ≤ n < m ≤ 1000, and 2 ≤ d ≤ 10. The line 0 0 0 will indicate end of input and should not be processed.

### 输出格式

For each input set, output a single line consisting of a comma-separated list of integers forming a degree d anti-prime sequence (do not insert any spaces and do not split the output over multiple lines). In the case where more than one anti-prime sequence exists, print the lexicographically first one (i.e., output the one with the lowest first value; in case of a tie, the lowest second value, etc.). In the case where no anti-prime sequence exists, output:

> No anti-prime sequence exists.
