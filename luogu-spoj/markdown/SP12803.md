# GRAPH2 - Graph

## 题目描述

Given an undirected graph with **n** nodes and **m** weighted edges, every node having one of two colors - black (denoted as 0) and white (denoted as 1). You are to perform **q** operations of two kinds:

1. **C** x: Change the _x_-th node´s color. A black node should be changed into a white node, and vice versa.

2. **Q** A B: Find the sum of weight of edges whose two end points of color A and B. A and B can be either 0 or 1.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers **n** (1<=**n**<=10^5) and **m**(1<=**m**<= 10^5) specified above.

The second line contains **n** integers, the _i_-th of which represents the color of the _i_-th node, 0 for black and 1 for white.

The following **m** lines represent edges. Each line has three integer u, v and w(1<=u, v<=n, u!=v), indicating there is an edge of weight w between u and v. w fits into 32-bit signed integer.

The next line contains only one integer **q**(1<=**q**<= 10^5), the number of operations.

The following **q** lines - operations mentioned above. See samples for detailed format.

### 输出格式

For each **Q** query, print one line containing the desired answer.See samples for detailed format.
