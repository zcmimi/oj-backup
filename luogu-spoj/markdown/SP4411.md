# EXPR3 - Counting Expressions

## 题目描述

Count the number of distinct expressions involving _n_ different operands **a**, **b**, **c**, etc. Only operators +, -, \*, / and parentheses are permitted. Single minus operator (for ex. -a\*b) is not allowed.

Two expression are distinct if for some valid input values (i.e. You won't divide some number by zero) **a**, **b**, **c**, ... , the two expressions leads to different results. For example, a/b/c and a/(b\*c) are the same expressions, but a/b+c and a/(b+c) are not.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式
