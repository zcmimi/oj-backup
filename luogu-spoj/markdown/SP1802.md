# EDGE - Edge

## 题目描述

 For products that are wrapped in small packings it is necessary that the sheet of paper containing the directions for use is folded until its size becomes small enough. We assume that a sheet of paper is rectangular and only folded along lines parallel to its initially shorter edge. The act of folding along such a line, however, can be performed in two directions: either the surface on the top of the sheet is brought together, or the surface on its bottom. In both cases the two parts of the rectangle that are separated by the folding line are laid together neatly and we ignore any differences in thickness of the resulting folded sheet.

After several such folding steps have been performed we may unfold the sheet again and take a look at its longer edge holding the sheet so that it appears as a one-dimensional curve, actually a concatenation of line segments. If we move along this curve in a fixed direction we can classify every place where the sheet was folded as either `type A` meaning a clockwise turn or `type V` meaning a counter-clockwise turn. Given such a sequence of classifications, produce a drawing of the longer edge of the sheet assuming 90 degree turns at equidistant places.
