# GUESSNM2 - Guess the Numbers

## 题目描述

John has never been very good at maths. Due to his bad grades, his parents have sent him to the Academic Coalition of Mathematics (ACM). Despite the large amount of money his parents are spending on the ACM, John does not pay much attention during classes. However, today he has begun to think about all the effort his parents are putting into his education, and he has started to feel somewhat… guilty. So he has made a decision: he is going to improve his maths grades!
