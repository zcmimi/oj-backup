# BUYINT - Buying Integers

## 题目描述

**Buying Integers**

Let's assume that you have **n** integers, **A $ _{1,} $ A $ _{2,} $ A $ _{3} $** … **A $ _{n} $**

Let's define,

**E =** Number of pairs **(i,j)** such that **i<j** and **( A $ _{i} $ + $ _{} $ A $ _{j} $ )** are even . **O** **=** Number of pairs **(i,j)** such that **i= 0 , -(E-O)** otherwise .

Unfortunately, you do have **n** but those **n** integers are lost . You will have to buy them again. Before going to the market, you have decided that you will buy **n** integers in such a way that the value of **D** will be as small as possible, as you will have to pay **D** golden coins, to buy them.

Now,you are wondering, what that minimum **D \[**Let's say it **D $ _{min} $ \]** will be .

**Input**

First line of the input file will contain the number of test cases, ****T** , followed by **T** lines, each containing an integer **n** (**1** n** 10 $ ^{9} $ ) .

**Output**

For each case, print the case number starting from 1 and **D $ _{min} $** for the value of **n** in that particular case. See the sample output for exact formatting.

**Sample Input**

**Output for Sample Input**

Case 1: 1

Case 2: 0

Case 3: 2

**Warning** : Input file is huge, please use faster input and output methods (e.g. printf and scanf in C++) .
