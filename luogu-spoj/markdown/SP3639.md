Any number containing only 8s and 6s is considered lucky number, e.g. 6, 8, 66, 668, 88, 886 …. Nguyen is a student who likes mathematics very much. Nguyen likes lucky numbers but only of the form

S = 8…86…6

where S has at least one digit and the number of 8s or 6s can be zero. Examples of S are 8, 88, 6, 66, 86, 886, 8866 …
