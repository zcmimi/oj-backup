## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input starts with a ﬂoating point number T with 2 decimal digits, 0.5 < T < 1, and a positive integer N 1 000. Next follow N positive integer weights w $ _{1} $ , w $ _{2} $ , ..., w $ _{N} $ . All weights are less than 10 $ ^{6.} $

### 输出格式

Output the minimum number of cuts needed to make the ratio between the resulting minimum weight piece and the resulting maximum weight piece be above T. You may assume that the number of cuts needed is less than 500.

To avoid issues with ﬂoating point numbers, you can assume that the optimal answer for ratio T is the same as for ratio T + 0.0001.
