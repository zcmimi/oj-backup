Little John is playing very funny game with his younger brother. There is

one big box filled with M&Ms of different colors. At first John has

to eat several M&Ms of the same color. Then his opponent has to make a turn.

And so on. Please note that each player has to eat at least one M&M

during his turn. If John (or his brother) will eat the last M&M from the

box he will be considered as a looser and he will have to buy a new candy box.

You will be given information about M&Ms and your task is to determine a

winner of such a beautiful game.
