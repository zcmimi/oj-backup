# TETRAHED - Point in tetrahedron

## 题目描述

There're given 5 points in 3D coordinates (integers 0<=x,y,z<100). Their order is arbitrary. 4 of them are the vertices of a tetrahedron whose edges can be of different size. One is lying in this tetrahedron. Find its index (1-5) in the array of points.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

In the first line the number T (T<1000) of test cases.

Then for each test case 5 lines with the space separated x-, y- and z-coordinates of the 5 points.

### 输出格式

For each test case a line with the index of that point which is lying in the tetrahedron formed of the 4 other points.
