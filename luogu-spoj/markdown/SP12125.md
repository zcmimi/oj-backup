# FIBOSQRT - Fibonacci With a Square Root

## 题目描述

FIBONACCI is the recursive sequence that is given by: F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) with F(0)=0 and F(1)=1

In this problem we define FIBOSQRT that is given by: Fs(n)=Fs(n-1)+Fs(n-2)+2\*SQRT(3+Fs(n-1)\*Fs(n-2)) with Fs(0) and Fs(1) are given in the input file.

It's guaranteed that SQRT(3+Fs(n-1)\*Fs(n-2)) is always an integer. ![Wink](../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif "Wink") I've proved it by math theorem.

Now your task is to find Fs(n)

Since the number can be Big you have to find the result mod M.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line is an integer T(1 T

For each test case, there are four integers **Fs(0)**,**Fs(1)**(1 M(1 M < 10 $ ^{9} $ ), and **n**(0 n < 10 $ ^{18} $ ) written in one line, separated by space.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output Fs(**n**) mod **M**.
