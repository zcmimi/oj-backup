# UCI2009B - Binomial Coefficients

## 题目描述

We all got too excited when we learned (A + B)^2 = A^2 + 2AB + B^2. After solving this problem, maybe you could get even more excited because you will have to calculate (A + B)^N, where (0 <= N <= 1000).

Follow the rules below when giving the answer:

1. Consecutive terms must be separated by a '+' character.

2. At the i-th term, A must be raised to N - i and B must be raised to i (0<=i<=N).

3. Binomial coefficients must not be printed, print their prime factorization instead.

4. Use '^' for exponentiation and 'x' for multiplication in step 3.

5. Avoid the use of number 1 when possible.

See sample output for clarification.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Input starts with an integer T, representing the number of test cases (1<=T<=15). T lines follow, each one consisting of an integer N, (0<=N<=1000).

### 输出格式

For each test case, print (A + B)^N, on a single line.
