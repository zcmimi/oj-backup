# PHDISP - The Philosophical Dispute

## 题目描述

One day, mathematician and philosopher were engaged in a heated dispute.

Philosopher said:

\- Ideal line has only length and no width, therefore, no line can have an area.

Mathematician replied:

\- That's as it may be, but still you can ll a square with a line in such a way that there will be no gaps.

And you can't deny that a square has an area, and he grinned.

But Philosopher still wasn't convinced:

\- Show me this line, then.

\- With pleasure... - responded Mathematician and scribbled some equations on a piece of paper:

\- With t increasing, the point (x, y) will move around the square, forming a line.

\- So what? - asked Philosopher. How is it going to ll the entire square?

\- Indeed, it will, - said Mathematician, - Whichever point inside the square you draw, the line will eventually cross that point.

\- No, - replied Philosopher indignantly, - Anyway, I don't believe. When will the line cross this point? - and he put a thick dot inside the square.

Give Philosopher an answer.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

_t_ – number of tests \[_t_ <= 150\], than t test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains the coordinates (x0, y0) of the dot center (-1 <= x0, y0 <= 1). The second line contains eps <= 0.0001 - the radius of the dot (the dot is essentially a small circle).

### 输出格式

For each test case output any value of t in the segment \[0, 10^12\], which corresponds to the line crossing the dot, or "FAIL", if the line doesn't cross the dot.
