# TWENDS - Two Ends

## 题意翻译

### 题目描述

在双人游戏“Two Ends”中，牌的数目是一个偶数。每张卡片上有一个正整数。每轮游戏中，玩家轮流从任意一端取出一张牌，并将其放在自己的牌堆中。牌上整数之和高的玩家获胜。现在有一个策略——每次都选择一张牌上点数最大的牌，我们称之为贪婪策略。但是，这有时候也会使你输掉游戏，如下面的例子所示：（如果第一个玩家选择$3$而不是$4$，那么她会赢。）

$3$ $2$ $10$ $4$

现在后手玩家使用贪婪策略，先手玩家可以自由使用任何策略。您需要确定先手玩家的分数和后手玩家的分数之间的最大差值。

### 输入格式

将有多组测试用例。每组测试用例占一行，表示一次游戏。每行将以一个偶数$n$开头，后跟$n$个正整数。$n=0$表示输入结束。假设$n$不超过$1000$，且列表中的数字之和不超过$1000000$。

### 输出格式

对每个测试用例，输出格式如下（注意每组输出占一行）：

````In game m, the greedy strategy might lose by as many as p points.````

其中，$m$是游戏次数（从$1$开始），$p$是当后手玩家使用贪婪策略时，先手玩家的分数和后手玩家的分数之间的最大差值。当采用贪婪策略时，每轮游戏中玩家总是在牌的两端中取点数较大的一张牌。当两端牌的点数相同时，取左端的牌。

## 题目描述

 In the two-player game “Two Ends”, an even number of cards is laid out in a row. On each card, face up, is written a positive integer. Players take turns removing a card from either end of the row and placing the card in their pile. The player whose cards add up to the highest number wins the game. Now one strategy is to simply pick the card at the end that is the largest — we’ll call this the greedy strategy. However, this is not always optimal, as the following example shows: (The first player would win if she would first pick the 3 instead of the 4.)

3 2 10 4

You are to determine exactly how bad the greedy strategy is for different games when the second player uses it but the first player is free to use any strategy she wishes.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 There will be multiple test cases. Each test case will be contained on one line. Each line will start with an even integer n followed by n positive integers. A value of _n_ = 0 indicates end of input. You may assume that _n_ is no more than 1000. Furthermore, you may assume that the sum of the numbers in the list does not exceed 1,000,000.

### 输出格式

 For each test case you should print one line of output of the form:

**_In game m, the greedy strategy might lose by as many as p points._**

where _m_ is the number of the game (starting at game 1) and _p_ is the maximum possible difference between the first player’s score and second player’s score when the second player uses the greedy strategy. When employing the greedy strategy, always take the larger end. If there is a tie, remove the left end.
