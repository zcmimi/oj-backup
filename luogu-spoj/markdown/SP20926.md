# REVADD - Special Numbers (Reverse and Add)

## 题目描述

 A number $ N $ is called **special** iff it can be written as $$ N = \mathrm{reverse}(N_1) + N_1 = \mathrm{reverse}(N_2) + N_2, $$ where $ N_1 $ and $ N_2 $ are some positive integers and their number of digits (lengths) are different.

For example, $ 121 $ is a special number since $$ \begin{aligned}

121 &= \mathrm{reverse}(74) + 74 = \mathrm{reverse}(110) + 110 \\

&= 47 + 74 = 11 + 110.

\end{aligned} $$

There are only two special number less than $ 10,000 $ .

Find the first 5,000 smallest special numbers.
