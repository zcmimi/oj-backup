# MATCH - Perfect Matching

## 题目描述

You are given a bipartite graph with N(1<=N<=300) nodes on each side. Determine whether the number of perfect matching is odd or even.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line is an integer T(1<=T<=20) means the number of test cases. The following are T parts. Each part begin with an integer N(1<=N<=300) means the number of nodes on both sides. It followed with N lines, each line contains a 0/1 string. If the j(1<=j<=N)th character of the i(1<=i<=N)th line is 1, it means the i th node on left have an edge to the j th node on right. See the sample for details.

### 输出格式

T lines, each contain "Odd" or "Even", which means the parity of the number of the perfect matching. See the sample for details.
