# EXPR1 - Expression

## 题意翻译

一个加减法组成的算式，最前面的数字前也有一个加号或减号，问最少要添加几个括号才能使算式的值成为$k$ （可能无解）

## 题目描述

 We are given an integer k and an arithmetic expression E with the operations '+', '-', and arguments from the set {0,1,...,9}. Is it possible to put some parentheses in E to get a new expression E' whose value equals k? If the answer is positive what is the minimum number of pairs of parentheses '(', ')' that are necessary?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of the input file contains one positive integer d not larger than 10. This is the number of data sets. The data sets follow. Each set of data occupies two consecutive lines of the input file. The first line contains two integers n and k, 2 <= n <= 40, -180 <= k <= 180. The even integer n is the length of E. The second line contains the expression itself written as a string of length n. The string contains operators '+' or '-' in odd positions and numbers from the set {0,1,...,9} in even positions.

### 输出格式

 For each i = 1,...,d, your program should write to the i-th line of the output file one word 'NO' if the i-th input expression cannot be transformed into any expression of value k, and the smallest number of pairs of parentheses necessary otherwise.
