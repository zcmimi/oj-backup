# VECTAR6 - Number of Binary Trees

## 题目描述

Changu has to deal with a very simple problem. He has to find the number of binary trees of height **n** where for each node the left subtree is at least as high as the right subtree.

**NOTE**: The height of the binary tree here is in terms of the nodes, i.e, number of nodes in the path from the root to the deepest leaf node. Hence, the height of a tree with only root node is 1.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains **T**, the number of test cases. The following **T** lines contain a number **N**.

### 输出格式

For each **N** output the number of binary trees of height **N** where for each node the left subtree is at least as high as the right subtree. As the answer can be large, you have to print answer modulus 1000000007
