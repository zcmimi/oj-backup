# TPCPALIN - Palindrome Merge

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/TPCPALIN/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/TPCPALIN/vn/)Given two strings s1 and s2. We can merge characters of two strings (with order in original strings) to get a new string.

For example : s1 = 'ab' and s2 = 'ba'.

We can merge to get st = 'a**b**b**a**' but not st = 'a**ab**b'.

**The Problem :** Given two string contain only lowercase letters, count the number of palindrome by merging in different ways.

Ex : 'aba', 'abba' are palindrome, 'abc' and 'abca' aren't.
