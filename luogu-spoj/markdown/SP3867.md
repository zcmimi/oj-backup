# VBOSS - Who is The Boss

## 题意翻译

# Description

若干调查表明， 你长得越高，你在企业里就能爬到更高的职位。在TALL公司，这个“事实标准” 已经被很好地规范化了：你的老板至少和你一样高，而且你可以确定你的老板挣得比你多一点。你可以确定，你的顶头上司是所有挣得比你多的人中挣得最少的人，并且至少和你一样高，而且，如果你是某人的顶头上司，那个人就是你的下属，并且他的所有下属也是你的下属。如果你不是任何人的老板，那么你就没有下属。这些规则很简单，许多为TALL工作的员工不知道应该把他们的每周进度报告交给哪些人，以及他们有多少下属。 请编写一个程序，对任何一个员工确定谁是这个员工的顶头上司，以及他有多少下属。TALL为了保证质量，已制订了一系列测试，以确保您的程序是正确的。这些测试说明如下。

# Input

在输入的第一行是一个正整数n，表示后面给出的测试用例的数目。每个测试用例的第一行给出两个正整数m和q，其中 m (至多30000) 是员工人数， q (至多200) 是查询次数。后面的m行每行用3个整数表示一个员工： 员工 ID (6位十进制数，第一位不是0)，年薪（以欧元为单位）和高度（以μm为单位，1 μm = $10^{-6}$米，在TALL，精度是很重要的)。总裁挣得比所有员工都多，并且是公司里最高的人。后面的q行给出查询，每个查询给出一个合法的员工 ID。

薪水是正整数，最多达10 000 000。不存在两个员工有相同的ID，并且不存在两个员工薪水相同。员工的身高至少1 000 000 μm，最多2 500 000 μm.

# Output

对于在一个查询中给出的每个员工的ID x，输出一行，给出用一个空格分开的两个整数 y k，其中y是x的老板的ID，k是x的下属的数目。如果查询给出总裁的ID，那么你要输出 0作为他或她的老板的ID (因为除了上帝，总裁没有顶头上司)。

## 题目描述

Several surveys indicate that the taller you are, the higher you can climb the corporate ladder. At TALL Enterprises Inc. this "de facto standard" has been properly formalized: your boss is always at least as tall as you are. Furthermore, you can safely assume that your boss earns a bit more than you do. In fact, you can be absolutely sure that your immediate boss is the person who earns the least among all the employees that earn more than you and are at least as tall as you are. Furthermore, if you are the immediate boss of someone, that person is your subordinate, and all his subordinates are your subordinates as well. If you are nobody's boss, then you have no subordinates. As simple as these rules are, many people working for TALL are unsure of to whom they should be turning in their weekly progress report and how many subordinates they have. Write a program that will help in determining for any employee who the immediate boss of that employee is and how many subordinates they have. Quality Assurance at TALL have devised a series of tests to ensure that your program is correct. These test are described below.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

On the first line of the input is a single positive integer n, telling the number of test scenarios to follow. Each scenario begins with a line containing two positive integers m and q, where m (at most 30000) is the number of employees and q (at most 200) is the number of queries. The following m lines each list an employee by three integers on the same line: employee ID number (six decimal digits, the first one of which is not zero), yearly salary in Euros and finally height in μm (1 μm = 10-6 meters - accuracy is important at TALL). The chairperson is the employee that earns more than anyone else and is also the tallest person in the company. Then there are q lines listing queries. Each query is a single legal employee ID.

The salary is a positive integer which is at most 10 000 000. No two employees have the same ID,and no two employees have the same salary. The height of an employee is at least 1 000 000 μm and at most 2 500 000 μm.

### 输出格式

For each employee ID x in a query output a single line with two integers y k, separated by one space character, where y is the ID of x's boss, and k is the number of subordinates of x. If the query is the ID of the chairperson, then you should output 0 as the ID of his or her boss (since the chairperson has no immediate boss except, possibly, God).
