# TREEOI14 - Trees

## 题意翻译

### 题目描述

给定一串序列$h_{i}$，定义序列的无序度为$|h_{1}-h_{2}|+|h_{2}-h_{3}|+...+|h_{n-1}-h_{n}|$，你可以任选一个数与给定数进行交换，当然也可以不交换。求交换后的最小无序度。

从标准输入读取数据，并使用标准输出。

### 输入格式

第一行输入一个整数$n$，第二行输入$n$个整数，每两个整数之间以空格分隔。

### 输出格式

输出包括$n$行，第$i$行输出一个整数，代表将第$i$个数与其他数进行交换所得到序列的最小无序度。

## 题目描述

Byteasar has a cottage. Lately, he has bought n trees and had them planted all in one row. Byteasar does not, however, like the order which the trees have been planted in. It particularly annoys him that tall and short ones have been mixed up, and the composition does not meet his aesthetic criteria.

Byteasar has invented a _disorder coefficient_ so as to allow the gardener to comprehend his intentions: the lower the value of the coefficient the prettier the row of trees. It is defined in the following way: |h $ _{1} $ −h $ _{2} $ |+ |h $ _{2} $ −h $ _{3} $ |+...+|h $ _{n&#8722;1} $ −h $ _{n} $ |, where h $ _{1} $ ,h $ _{2} $ , . . . ,h $ _{n} $ are the heights of consecutive trees in a row.

Replanting is a very toilsome and cumbersome task, therefore Byteasar has ordered the gardener to replant two trees at the most (i.e. interchange their positions). The task of the gardener is to choose the pair to replant in a way that makes the disorder coefficient the smallest.

The gardener is not sure if he has chosen the correct pair of trees and he fears he may lose his job if he is mistaken. Help him: for each tree calculate the minimal disorder coefficient that may be attained by switching places with any other tree.

### Task

Write a program which:

- reads the height of the consecutive trees in a row from the standard input,

- for each tree calculates the minimal disorder coefficient that may be attained should it switch places with some other tree (or should there be no change at all),

- writes the outcome to the standard output.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the standard input contains one integer _n_ (2 <= _n_ <= 50000). The other contains _n_ integers h $ _{i} $ (1 <= h $ _{i} $ <= 100000000) separated by single spaces, denoting the height of the consecutive trees in the row.

### 输出格式

The output should consist of precisely _n_ lines. The i-th line should contain a single integer - the smallest disorder coefficient attainable when considering replanting of the i-th tree.
