# LCPC11B - Co-Prime

## 题意翻译

输入的第一行包含T（0<T<=100）测试组的数量，接下来的每一行包含三个整数A、B、N，其中（1<=A<=B<=1015）和（1<=N<=109）。 要求求出区间【A,B】中与N互质的数的个数

## 题目描述

Given a number N, you are asked to count the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N.

Two integers are said to be co-prime or relatively prime if they have no common positive divisors other than 1 or, equivalently, if their greatest common divisor is 1. The number 1 is relatively prime to every integer.

Input Specification

The first line on input contains T (0 < T <= 100) the number of test cases, each of the next T lines contains three integers A, B, N where (1 <= A <= B <= 1015) and (1 <= N 

Output Specification

For each test case, print the number of integers between A and B inclusive which are relatively prime to N. Follow the output format below.

Sample Input

2

1 10 2

3 15 5

Sample Output

Case #1: 5

Case #2: 10

In the first test case, the five integers in range \[1,10\] which are relatively prime to 2 are {1,3,5,7,9}.
