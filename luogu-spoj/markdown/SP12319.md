# NITT2 - hai jolly jolly jolly

## 题目描述

 Alp and Gaut are like always opposite to each other. Once Alp told that he can identify a number which is divisible by 252 (He knows because that is his girlfriends birthday - 25/2). Now to come up against Alp, Gaut said he can identify whether the number is divisible by 525 (poor Gaut don't have a girl friend though). The truth is they don't know to do it for big numbers. So you are here to help them with a method. Given a number you have to tell whether the number is divisible by 252 and 525.
