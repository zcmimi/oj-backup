# HHAND - Hospital at Hands

## 题意翻译

# 题目描述

在某个国家的偏远地区，有一组城镇，离任何其他地区都很远。这些城镇由一组道路连接，任何两个城镇之间只有一条道路，并且每个城镇都是相连的。

***

阿波罗医院有限公司决定投资这一地区，并建立一些医院。他们的分析师面临着一项艰巨的任务。他的工作是从所有城镇中找出一组连续的城镇，在其中每个城镇建立一所医院。连接第一个城镇和最后一个城镇的路径（很明显要穿过组中所有其他城镇）长度不应超过L，以免给巡诊医生带来不便。此外，分析师必须确保他选择的目标城镇能够使得该地区的人们只需走最短的距离就能到达离他们最近的医院。

***

因此，选择将要修建医院的城镇时必须记住，为了到达离他们最近的医院，每个城镇的人们需要走的距离之和应该是最小的。你必须找到这个最小值。

***

# 输入输出格式

### 输入格式：

输入的第一行包含一个整数T，等于测试用例的数量。你需要处理所有测试用例，每个测试用例是由以一个空格分隔的整数N，L组成。N表示城镇的数量，L是连接集合中第一个和最后一个城镇的路径长度。接下来的N-1行包含由空格分隔的两个整数A和B，表示A和B之间的道路。A和B从0起计数。

### 输出格式：

输出由T行组成。输出中的第i行对应于第i个测试案例中所有城镇与最近医院之间距离的最小总和。

## 题目描述

In a remote part of the Country, there lies a group of towns, quite far from any other areas. These towns are connected by a set of roads, having the property that there is exactly one path connecting any two towns, and every town is connected.

Apollo Hospitals Ltd. decides to invest in this area, and build some Hospitals. Their analyst has a monumental task ahead of him. His job is to find out a Set of continuous towns, from among them, to build one hospital in each. The path connecting the first town to the last town in the set (which obviously passes through all the remaining ones) should not be more than length L, to avoid inconvenience to the visiting doctors. Also, the analyst has to make sure that his selection of target towns is such that the people of the area have to cover the least distance to reach the hospital closest to them.

Thus, the towns where Hospitals will be built have to be chosen keeping in mind that the sum of distances that people from each town will need to cover, in order to reach the Hospital closest to them, should be Minimum. You have to find this minimum sum.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input contains an integer T which is equal to the number of test cases. You are required to process all test cases.Each test case starts with 2 space separated integers N,L. N denotes the number of towns and L is the length of path connecting first and last town in the set. Next N-1 lines follow each contains two space separated integers a and b denoting a road between A and B. A and B are 0 based.

### 输出格式

Output consists of T lines. I $ ^{th} $ line in the output corresponds to the minimum sum total of the distances of all the towns with the nearest hospital for the I $ ^{th} $ test case.
