# MATPROD - Symmetric matrix

## 题目描述

**\[NOTE: A harder version of this problem is [Symmetric Matrix 2](../MATPROD2/ "Symmetric Matrix 2"); you may want to try it once you solve this one.\]**

You are given an **N** x **N** matrix **m $ _{ij} $** such that **m $ _{ij} $ == m $ _{ji} $** for **i, j = 1, ..., N**. We would like to compute the value of

Note that in the above expression we are going over **K** indices **i $ _{1} $ , ..., i $ _{K} $** that run over the values **1, ..., N**, while summing over the product of all the **K\*(K-1)/2** possible matrix elements that we can form with these indices.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers **N** and **K** (**2 and **2 ), representing the number of rows and columns of the matrix **m $ _{ij} $** and the number of sums in the formula above, respectively. The following **N** lines contain **N** integers each, being the **j**-th number in the **i**-th line the value of ****m** $ _{ij} $** (**-10 and **m $ _{ij} $ == m $ _{ji} $** for **i, j = 1, ..., N**).******

### 输出格式

Print a single line with the result of the calculation. Because this number can be very big, output its remainder modulo division by **1000000007** (**== 10 $ ^{9} $ +7**).
