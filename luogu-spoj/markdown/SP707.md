# TFSETS - Triple-Free Sets

## 题目描述

 A set **S** of positive integers is called _strongly triple-free_ if, for any integer **x**, the sets {**x**, 2**x**} and {**x**, 3**x**} are not subsets of **S**. Let's define **F(n)** as a number of strongly triple-free subsets of {1, 2, ..., **n**}, where **n** is a natural number.

You need to write a program which being given a number **n** calculates the number **F(n)** modulo 1 000 000 001.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of input contains integer **T** (1 ≤ **T** ≤ 500) - the number of testcases. Then descriptions of **T** testcases follow.

The description of the testcase consists of one line. The line contains an integer number **n** (1 ≤ **n** ≤ 100 000).

### 输出格式

 For each testcase in the input your program should output one line. This line should contain one integer number which is the number **F(n)** modulo 1 000 000 001.
