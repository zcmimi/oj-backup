# LLCA - Largest Labeled Common Ancestor

## 题目描述

Given a labeled complete k-ary tree, find the largest labeled common ancestor of two given nodes. In a complete k-ary tree, the node in the tree is labeled sequentially from the left most child to right most child, level by level. Largest labeled common ancestor of A and B is defined as the largest labeled node in the tree which has A and B as descendants. A node is a descendant of itself.

**Be careful with your finger, the source limit is 256 bytes.**

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains an integer T (1 <= T <= 100) the number of cases. Each cases contains three integers K, A and B (2 <= K <= 100; 1 <= A,B <= 2,000,000,000).

### 输出格式

For each test case, output in a line the largest labeled common ancestor node.
