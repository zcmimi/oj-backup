# CHIGAME - Chinese game

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

$Mark$去了中国，学会了一个源自公元$3$世纪的中国古代游戏。在这个游戏中，每个玩家选择两个数字$A,B$（所有数字$B$必须是互质的）。玩家们围成一圈。最初每个玩家将$A$豆放在他左边的玩家面前。此时，每个玩家都会在他们的笔记本上记下他面前的豆子数量。现在比赛开始了。在每一轮中，每个玩家将$B$豆放在他右边的玩家面前。然后每个玩家在他们的笔记本上记下他们面前的豆子数量。轮次一直持续到所有玩家都在他们的笔记本上写下数字$C$。获胜者是在$C$之前写入更多数字的玩家。

举个栗子，假设有三名玩家，$Mark,George$和$Mike$。他们分别选择数字$(15,5),(17,8)$和$(16,7)$。最初$Mark$会在$Mike$面前放$15$个豆子，$George$会把$17$个豆子放在$Mark$面前，$Mike$只会在$George$面前放$16$个豆子。然后每个人都记下他们面前的数字（$17,16$和$15$）。现在每一轮$Mark$都会在$George$面前放$5$颗豆子，$George$会在$Mike$面前放$8$颗豆子，$Mike$会在$Mark$面前放$7$颗豆子。下表总结了每个人的笔记本上写的数字：

| $Mark$ | $George$ | $Mike$ |

| :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |

| $17$ | $16$ | $15$ |

| $24$ | $21$ | $23$ |

| $31$ | $26$ | $31$ |

| $38$ | $31$ | $39$ |

表格的最后一行是比赛的最后一轮，因为每个玩家已经记下了$31$号。所以现在胜利者是$George$，因为他在$31$之前写了$3$个数字。您的任务是在公共数字$C$出现之前打印获胜者所写的号码数量。由于游戏可能会变得相当无聊，因此在所有游戏中，获胜者的笔记本上写的数字将少于$2^{31}$。

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式：

输入将以玩家的数量$N$开始 $(2\le N\le10)$ 。接着，将有$N$行，每行包含一对数字$A_i,B_i(0\le A\le10^6,2\le B\le10^2)$，表示玩家$i$的数字$A$和$B$.

输入将以$N=0$结束

### 输出格式：

打印一行，其中包含获胜者在数字$C$之前写入的数字个数。

## 题目描述

Little Mark went to China and learned an ancient chinese game dating from the 3 $ ^{rd} $ century. In this game every player chooses two numbers A, B (all pairs of numbers B must be coprime). The players gather around in a circle. Initially each player puts A beans in front of the player on his left. At this point each player writes down on their notebook the number of beans he has in front of him. Now the game starts by rounds. On every round each player will place B beans in front of the player at his right. Then each player writes down on their notebook the number of beans in front of them. The rounds keep going until there is a number C that all players have written on their notebook. The winner is the player with more numbers written before C.

For example, lets suppose there are three players, Mark, George and Mike. They choose the numbers 15 5, 17 8 and 16 7 respectively. Initially Mark would put 15 beans in front of Mike, George would put 11 beans in front of Mark and Mike would but 16 beans in front of George. Then everybody writes down the number in front of them (17,16 and 15). Now on each round Mark will put 5 beans in front of George, George will put 8 beans in front of Mike, and Mike will put 7 beans in front of Mark. The following table summarizes the numbers written on each person’s notebook:

Mark George Mike 17 16 15 24 21 23 31 26 31 38 31 39The last row of the table is the last round of the game, since the number 31 has already been written down by each player. So now the winner is George, since he has 3 numbers written before the 31.

Your task is to print the amount of numbers that the winner wrote before the common number C showed up. Since the game can get quite boring, in all the games the winner will have less than 2^31 numbers written on his notebook.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input will begin with the number N of players (2<=N<=10). Following, there will be N lines, each containing a pair of numbers Ai, Bi (0<=A<=10^6, 2<=B<=10^2) indicating the numbers A and B for player i.

The end of the input will be a case with N=0

### 输出格式

For each test case on the input you must print a line containing the amount of lines that the winner wrote before the common number C.
