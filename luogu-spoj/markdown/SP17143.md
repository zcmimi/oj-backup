# PSYCHO3 - Make Psycho

## 题目描述

**Problem Statement**:

```

The number N is called Psycho Number . Psycho Number is calculated as follows:

First, If we factorize N , then we have some prime and their power. Assume that, there are M powers. From M powers , you should count the number of even and odd powers. Then if the number of even power is strictly greater than odd power , then we call the number N is “Psycho Number”, otherwise the number N is call “Ordinary Number”.

As for example, if N = 67500 then prime factorization, 67500 = 22 x 33 x 54. Count even powers and odd powers . This number have 2 even power(2,4) and 1 odd power ( 3 ). Since even power 2 (2,4) is greater than odd power 1 (3), so the number 67500 is a Psycho Number.

```

Now, Given an integer **K**, your task is to find whether it is possible to form a subset consisting of only psycho numbers that sum up to exactly **K**, or not.

**Input**:

The first line of the input contains an integer, **T** (1 T N (1 N K (1 K . The second line of each test case contains the sequence of integers p $ _{1} $ , p $ _{2} $ , ..., p $ _{n} $ (0

**Output:**

For each case print “**Yes**” if possible to make **K** . otherwise “**No**”.

  3 24

  4 4 16

 Yes

 No

 Yes

 

Explanation :

1st test case : psycho numbers : 4 and 16 .

possible number: 4, 16 and 20 (4+16).

k is 20 so you can make this number .

2nd test case : psycho numbers : only 9

k is 3 but it's not possible to make subset of psycho numbers which sum is equal to k .

3rd test case : psycho numbers : 4 4 16

possible number : 4 , 16 , 20(16+4) and 24 (16+4+4)

k is 24 so you can make this number .

Note : 0 and 1 is not a psycho number .

Psycho 1 : Psycho

Psycho 2 : Psycho Function
