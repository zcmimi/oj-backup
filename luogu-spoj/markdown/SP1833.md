# SUDOKU2 - Sudoku

## 题意翻译

## 题目描述

$Bill$ 刚刚意识到，他过去十分钟尝试解决的数独题本质上是上周的题，只是把格子逆时针旋转。太坑了！杂志社难道不能每周出一道新题吗？ 但是，在开始做题之前，他无从得知这是同一道题，因为缺少的数字的位置不一样了。 尽管如此，意识到本周的题只是上周的简单衍生，无疑使剩下的部分变得无趣。

如果不知道数独的规则，请自行百度。

请写一个程序来检查未解决的数独谜题是否从较早的谜题派生而来，帮助 $Bill$ 帮助避免令人不快的意外。

可能的操作是：

顺时针或逆时针旋转整个数独。

在3×9列分段中交换两列。

在9×3行段内交换两行。

交换整个行或列段。

将整个数独中所有相同的数字替换为另一个数字（如所有1变成9，所有2变成3，以此类推）。

## 输入格式

第一行一个整数 $n$ $(0≤N≤50)$，表示共有n组数据。

对于每组数据，前9行为上周的数独，后9行为这周待解决的数独，0表示为空。

相邻两组数据以空格分割。

数据保证所给数独有且仅有一组解。

## 输出格式

对于每组数据，如果可以由上周的数独变化而来，输出 Yes ，否则输出No

## 题目描述

Oh no! Bill just realized that the sudoku puzzle he had spent the last ten minutes trying to solve essentially was last week's puzzle, only rotated counterclockwise. How cheap! Couldn't the magazine afford to make a new one every week? Of course, he had no way of knowing about this before he started to solve it, as the holes to fill with digits were other than last week. Nevertheless, realizing that this week's puzzle was a simple derivative of last week's certainly took the fun out of solving the rest of it.

Some of the cells are filled with a digit 1 through 9 while the rest of them are left empty. The aim of the game is to fill each empty cell with a digit 1...9 so that every row, every column and every region contains each of the numbers 1...9 exactly once. A proper sudoku puzzle always has exactly one solution.

Help Bill avoid unpleasant surprises by creating a program that checks whether an unsolved sudoku puzzle is in fact derived from an earlier puzzle by simple operations.

The allowed operations are:

- Rotating the entire puzzle clockwise or counterclockwise.

- Swapping two columns within a 3×9 column segment.

- Swapping two rows within a 9×3 row segment.

- Swapping entire row or column segments.

- Applying a permutation _f_ of the digits 1...9 to every cell (i.e. replace _x_ by _f(x)_ in every cell).

An operation is considered being performed on the sudoku solution (rather than on the unsolved puzzle) and always guarantees that if the board before the transformation was a solution to a sudoku puzzle, it still is afterwards.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The input starts with the number of test cases 0 ≤ _N_ ≤ 50 on a single line.

Then for every test case follow nine lines describing last week's puzzle solution, from top to bottom. Each line corresponds to a row in the puzzle and consists of nine digits (1...9), describing the contents of the cell from left to right.

Last week's solution is followed by nine lines describing this week's unsolved puzzle. Here, also, every line corresponds to a puzzle row and every digit (0...9) describes the contents of a cell. 0 indicates that the cell is empty. The rows are presented ordered from top to bottom, and within each row, the cells are ordered from left to right.

After every test case except the last one follows a blank line. Every unsolved puzzle is guaranteed to be uniquely solvable and last week's solution is always a proper sudoku solution. /p>

### 输出格式

For every test case, output Yes if the sudoku puzzle can be derived from the given solved puzzle using the allowed operations, or No if this is not possible.
