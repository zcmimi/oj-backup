## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer _T_, the number of test cases. On the next _T_ lines, you will be given two integers _N_ and _M_. Consider the family of any finite sum of ( _n_-periodic functions with _n_ in \[1.._N_\] ). All those functions share a common smallest period.

### 输出格式

 Print the smallest common period of that family. As the answer can get very big, simply output it modulo _M_.
