# FPLAN - Field Plan

## 题目描述

World Soccer Championship is coming soon and coach Yogi wants to prepare his team as well as possible. So he made up a strategy field plan for every player of the team. One plan describes a number of possible locations for the player on the field. Moreover, if Yogi wants the player to be able to move from one location _A_ to another location _B_ then the plan specifies the ordered pair _(A,B)_. He is sure that his team will win if the players run over the field from one location to another using only moves of the plan.

Yogi tells every player to follow his plan and to start from a location that reaches every other location on the plan (by possibly multiple moves). However, it is quite difficult for some soccer players, simple minded as they are, to find a suitable starting location. Can you help every player to figure out the set of possible start locations?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line gives the number of field plans. The input contains at most eleven field plans (what else?). Every plan starts with a line of two integers _N_ and _M_, with _1 and _1 , giving the number of locations and the number of moves. In the following _M_ lines a plan specifies moves _(A,B)_ by two white space separated integers _0 . The plans are separated by a blank line.___

### 输出格式

For every plan print out all possible starting locations, sorted increasingly and one per line. If there are no possible locations to start, print **Confused**. Print a blank line after each plan output.
