# DARTS - Darts

## 题目描述

After a long week of work at the ICPC Headquarters, Bill and his friends usually go to a small pub on Friday evenings to have a couple of beers and play darts. All of them are well aware of the fact that their ability at darts decreases at the same rate as the amount of beer left in their mugs.

They always play 501, one of the easiest games. Players start with a score of _N_ points (typically, _N_=501, hence the name) and take turns throwing darts. The score of each player decreases by the value of the section hit by the dart, unless the score becomes negative, in which case it remains unchanged. The first player to reach a score of 0 wins. The figure below shows the dartboard with which the game is played.
