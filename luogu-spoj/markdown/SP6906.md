# RPAR - Raining Parabolas

## 题目描述

It's raining parabolas!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers: N and M ( 1 <= N, M <= 100000 ). N specifies the number of blocks on the floor, and M is the number of queries. Each of the next M lines contains a query. As we already said, we have two types of queries of form:

0 x $ _{0} $ x $ _{1} $ a b c (0 <= x $ _{0} $ <= x $ _{1&nbsp;} $ < N, 0 <= a, b, c <= 10006, **all integers** )

this type of query just tells you that a parabola has

fallen into the interval \[x $ _{0} $ , x $ _{1} $ \], and its function is f(x) = ax $ ^{2} $ + bx + c

1 x $ _{0} $ x $ _{1&nbsp;} $ ( 0 <= x $ _{0} $ <= x $ _{1} $ < N, **all integers** )

this is the type of query you have to answer - output the sum of heights

of all the blocks from interval \[x $ _{0} $ , x $ _{1} $ \] modulo 10007

### 输出格式

For each query of type 1, output a single line containing the sum of all the heights in the given interval modulo 10007.
