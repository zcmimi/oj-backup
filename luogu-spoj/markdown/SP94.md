# MAYA - Numeral System of the Maya

## 题意翻译

玛雅人在第一个千年生活在中美洲。在许多方面，他们构成了这个时代最发达、最迷人的文化之一。尽管玛雅人不知道牵引动物和轮子，但他们擅长编织、建筑和陶器领域。但是真正令人惊叹的是他们在天文学和数学领域的成就。当欧洲艰难地走过黑暗的中世纪时，玛雅人确定太阳年为365.242天(现代测量值: 365.242198 )，月亮周期为29.5302天(现代测量值: 29.53059 )。如果没有强大的数字系统，这种惊人的精确发现几乎是不可能的。在这个任务中，我们将探索玛雅的数字系统。

玛雅祭司和天文学家使用一个数字系统来计算20的基数。对他们的时代来说不寻常的是，他们的系统还包括数字和零的概念。欧洲人当时完全不知道这两个概念。根据下表，vigesimal系统的前十九个数字由点和虚线表示:

零被记为类似贝壳的符号。多位数字(即大于19的数字)以垂直排列方式书写，最高值的数字在顶部。例如，数字79被写为

可以看出，第二个数字的值为20。

由于玛雅两个日历系统的干扰，第三个数字并没有像预期的那样保持400 (20x20 )，而是保持360。以下所有数字都被定期处理，即第四个数字计数为7200 (360x20 )，第五个数字计数为144000 (7200x20 )，依此类推。

因此，编号13495 (=1x7200+17x360+8x20+15 )写如下:

编写一个程序将玛雅数字转换成十进制数字！

输入文件包含以Maya方式写下的数字列表。当然，点被表示为点( .)，破折号表示为连字符( - )。零位数，即外壳符号，被写成大写字母S (S )。玛雅数字的描述以n开始——玛雅数字的数字。以下n行各包含一个数字。使用空格作为垂直分隔符，从上到下写一个数字。

一个数字不超过七位数。每两个数字用一个空行隔开。输入以n = 0结束

输出格式:

你的程序必须输出输入文件中数字的值，在现在更常见的十进制系统中。每行一个数字

## 题目描述

The Maya lived in Central America during the first millennium. In many regards, they consituted one of the most developed and most fascinating cultures of this epoch. Even though draught animals and the wheel were unknown to the Mayas, they excelled in the fields of weaving, architecture and pottery. But truely breath-taking were their achievements in the fields of astronomy and mathematics. Whilst Europe was trudging through the dark Middle Ages, the Maya determined the solar year to 365.242 days (modern-day measurement: 365.242198) and the lunar cycle to 29.5302 days (modern-day measurement: 29.53059). Such astonishingly precise findings were hardly possible without a powerful numeral system. In this task we will explore the Maya's numeral system.

Maya priests and astronomers used a numerical system to the base of 20. Unusual to their time, their system also included the concepts of digits and of the zero. Both concepts were completely unknown to the Europeans at this time. The first nineteen numbers of the vigesimal system were represented by dots and dashes according to the following table:

The zero was written down as a symbol resembling a shell. Multi-digit numbers (i.e. the numbers bigger than 19) were written in vertical arrangement, with the highest-value digit on top. For example, the number 79 was written as

As can be seen, the second digit possesses a value of 20.

Due to an interference of the two calendar systems of the Maya, the third digit did not hold the value 400 (20x20), as would be expected, but 360. All the following digits were again treated regularly, i.e. the fourth digit counted 7200 (360x20), the fifth 144000 (7200x20), and so on.

Hence, the number 13495 (=1x7200+17x360+8x20+15) was written as follows:

Write a program to convert Maya numbers to decimal numbers!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input file contains a list of numbers written down in Maya fashion. Of course, dots are represented as points (.), and dashes are represented as hyphens (-). The zero digit, the shell symbol, is written as a capital letter S (S). Description of a Maya number starts with _n_ - the number of the Maya digits. The following _n_ lines contain one digit each. One digit is written from top to bottom using spaces as vertical separators.

One number will not have more than seven digits. Each two numbers are separated by a blank line. Input terminates with _n_ = 0

### 输出格式

Your program has to output the value of the number in the input file in the nowadays more common decimal system. One number per line.
