# MULTII - Yet Another Multiple Problem

## 题目描述

Given a positive integer **N** (1 <= **N** <= 10000) and some digits, find the smallest positive multiple of **N** whose decimal notation does not contain any of the given digits.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers **N** and _m_ separated by a single space. The second line contains _m_ digits separated by spaces. Input terminates by EOF.

### 输出格式

For each test case output its case number (starting from 1) and the answer in a single line, or "-1" (without quotes) if the answer doesn't exist.
