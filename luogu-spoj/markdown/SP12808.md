# TREEII - Yet-Yet Another Counting Problem

## 题目描述

Count the number of rooted trees with n nodes, which satiesfy the following condition:

If the distance between node A and the root equals to the distance between node B and the root, then A and B must have same number of (direct) children.

Two trees are considered identical if and only if there's a bijection of n nodes which transforms one tree into another one.

Since the answer can be very large, output the answer modules 1000000007.
