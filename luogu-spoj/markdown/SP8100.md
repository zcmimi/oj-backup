# SHLIGHTS - Shifting Lights

## 题目描述

Recently I made a new device. It contains a set of lightbulbs, each having two parts. The left part glows blue and the right part glows green. One cannot guess which parts of the bulbs will be glowing when the device is powered on. Consider any two adjacent bulbs at time t. If the left bulb is glowing green and the right bulb is glowing blue they swap their states to blue and green respectively at time t + 1. But now I am wondering, if I power it on when will the bulbs stop swapping. Can you help me with this ?
