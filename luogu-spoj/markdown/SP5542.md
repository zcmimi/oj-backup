# CPAIR - Counting pairs

## 题目描述

You're given a sequence A of N non-negative integers. Answer Q queries, where each query consists of three integers: v, a, b. The answer is number of pairs of integers i and j that satisfy these conditions:

1 <= i <= j <= N

a <= j-i+1 <= b

A\[k\] >= v for every integer k between i and j, inclusive

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers, N and Q. The second line contains the sequence A, consisting of N integers. Each of the next Q lines contains three numbers, v, a and b, defining a query.

### 输出格式

In the i-th line output only one integer denoting the answer to the i-th query.
