# AMOEBA - Amoeba

## 题目描述

Dr. Fulano found a new species of microorganism, the fast-growing-amoeba. The colony of this

kind of amoeba grows vary fast. To find out the exacty rate of growth of the colony, Dr. Fulano

wrote down for several days, the number of amoebae in the colony. Soon he realized that each

individual generate daily, 6 new individuals. As the number of amoebae grew very quickly, Dr.

Fulano noted only the last K digits. When he realized that the numbers noted were repeated, it was

too late! The research was already well advanced and there was no time to recount. The solution

was to ask for help from you.

Doctor Fulano will give to you a number of K digits (0 < K < 10), possibly with leading zeroes. You

should answer the first day he wrote down that number. Consider that in day 1, the colony was

composed of 1 amoeba. Consider also that an amoeba does not disappear when generating his

descendants.

If there is no answer to the number given, print -1.
