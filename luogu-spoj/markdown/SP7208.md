# BORW - Black or White

## 题意翻译

“它是黑色的，它是白色的，你很难通过”迈克尔杰克逊(1958-2009)

您有一个整数序列。您可以将每个整数绘制为黑色或白色，也可以将其保留在未绘制的位置。黑色整数必须按升序显示，白色整数必须按降序显示。升序/降序必须严格，即两个颜色相同的整数不能相等。绘制顺序，最小化未绘制整数的数量。

## 题目描述

“_It’s Black, It’s White, It’s Tough For You To Get By_”

Michael Jackson (1958-2009)

You have a sequence of integers. You can paint each of the integers black or white, or leave

it unpainted. The black integers must appear in ascending order and the white integers

must appear in descending order. The ascending/descending order must be strict, that

is, two integers painted with the same color cannot be equal. Paint the sequence so as to

minimize the number of unpainted integers.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly two lines. The first line

contains an integer N indicating the number of elements in the sequence (1 The second line contains N integers Xi separated by single spaces, representing the

sequence to paint (1 single −1 and should not be processed as a test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case output a single line with an integer representing the minimum number

of unpainted elements of the sequence, when the sequence is painted optimally following

the rules described above.
