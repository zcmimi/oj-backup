# HPFORF - HARRY POTTER AND THE FORBIDDEN FOREST

## 题意翻译

伏地魔回来了，这次更加强大。为了保持不朽这一次，他将自己的灵魂分成了超过7个部分（horcrux）并将它们隐藏在禁林中。

禁林由nxm细胞的矩形场表示。每个单元格都是空的或有塔。空单元格标有'。' 带塔的细胞标有'*'。每对相邻的不同类型的单元（一个空的，一个有一个塔）在塔的墙上有一个洞，其中隐藏着一个horcrux。

由于哈利波特是被选中的人，他必须通过寻找最大可能数量的魂器来尽可能地削弱伏地魔。哈利从一个空单元开始，只能移动到那些与当前单元共享一个共同侧面的空单元。哈利可以找到那些与哈利将要去的牢房相邻的塔壁上的洞穴。

注意：一个塔可以有一个以上的孔（因此有一个以上的horcrux），每个孔在不同的墙壁上有一个相邻的空单元。

对于不同的起始位置，您必须计算出多少Horcrux Harry Potter可以找到。

## 题目描述

Voldemort is back and this time even more stronger. To stay immortal this time he has divided his soul into more than 7 parts (horcrux) and has hidden them in the Forbidden Forest.

Forbidden Forest is represented by a rectangular field of n x m cells. Each cell is either empty or has a tower. Empty cells are marked with ‘.’ and cells with tower are marked with ‘\*’. Every pair of adjacent cells of different type (one empty and one having a tower) has a hole in the wall of the tower with one horcrux hidden.

As Harry Potter is the chosen one he has to weaken Voldemort as much as he can by finding maximum possible number of horcrux. Harry starts from an empty cell and can only move to those empty cells which share a common side with the current one. Harry can find those horcrux which is in a hole of the wall of the tower adjacent to the cell which Harry will visit.

Note: One tower can have more than one holes (and thus more than one horcrux), each in different walls having an adjacent empty cell.

For different starting positions you have to calculate how many Horcrux Harry Potter can find.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains an integer t - number of test cases.

Each test case contains three integers n, m and k - dimension of the Forbidden Forest and the number of starting positions to process.

3 n,m 500

1 k min(n\*m, 100000)

Each of the next n lines contains m symbols ‘.’ or ‘\*’ - description of the Forbidden Forest. All the border cell are guaranteed to be ‘\*’ so that Harry don’t go out of the Forest.

Each of the last k lines contains two integers x and y (1 x n, 1 y m) - the row and column of one of the starting position of Harry Potter respectively. Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns from left to right. All starting positions are guaranteed to be empty cells.

### 输出格式

Print k integers (each in new line) - the maximum number of Horcrux Harry Potter can find if he starts in the corresponding position.
