# FACTMULN - Product of factorials (easy)

## 题目描述

For n positive integer, let **_F(n) = 1! × 2! × 3! × 4! × ... × n!_**, product of factorial(i) for i in \[1..n\]. Let **_G(n) = {i in \[1..n\], such that n divides F(i)}_**. It is obvious that **_n_** belongs to **_G(n)_** that makes it a non empty set.
