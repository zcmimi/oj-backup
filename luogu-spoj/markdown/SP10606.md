# BALNUM - Balanced Numbers

## 题意翻译

一个数被称为是平衡的数当且仅当对于所有出现过的数位，偶数出现奇数次，奇数出现偶数次。给定A,B，请统计出[A，B]内所有平衡数的个数。

1<=A<=B<=10^19

## 题目描述

Balanced numbers have been used by mathematicians for centuries. A positive integer is considered a balanced number if:

1\) Every **even** digit appears an **odd** number of times in its decimal representation

2\) Every **odd** digit appears an **even** number of times in its decimal representation

For example, 77, 211, 6222 and 112334445555677 are balanced numbers while 351, 21, and 662 are not.

Given an interval \[A, B\], your task is to find the amount of balanced numbers in \[A, B\] where both **A and B are included.**

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains an integer T representing the number of test cases.

A test case consists of two numbers A and B separated by a single space representing the interval. You may assume that 1 <= A <= B <= 10 $ ^{19} $

### 输出格式

For each test case, you need to write a number in a single line: the amount of balanced numbers in the corresponding interval
