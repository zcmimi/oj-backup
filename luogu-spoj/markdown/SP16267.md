# REALNO - Real Numbers

## 题目描述

```

Find whether there exists a pair of real nos. whose sum is in range (1,2) in an array consisting of real nos. in the range (0,2). If there exists such a pair print "found" else print "not found". (double quotes for clarity)

Note: all intervals given above are open intervals.

INPUT:

First line is the number of test cases t (t<=6),

then for each case no. of real nos. in the array is given (n)

then in the next line the real nos. are given.

OUTPUT:print the required ans, i.e., "found" or "not found"

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 3*10^5

e.g.,

 

Input:

2

3

0.7 0.5 1.2

5

1.2 1.3 1.22 0.999 1.5
