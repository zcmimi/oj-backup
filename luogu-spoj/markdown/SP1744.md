# POLEVAL - Evaluate the polynomial

## 题目描述

Your task consists of evaluate a polynomial of degree **n** (0 <= **n** <= **999**) represented by its **n+1** coefficients of the form:

**p $ _{n} $ (x) = c $ _{n} $ x $ ^{n} $ + c $ _{n-1} $ x $ ^{n-1} $ + … + c $ _{2} $ x $ ^{2} $ + c $ _{1} $ x + c $ _{0} $** in each one of the **k** (**1** <= **k** <= **100**) points **x $ _{1} $** , **x $ _{2} $** , …, **x $ _{k} $** . The coefficients of the polynomial and the values where they will be evaluated are integers in the interval **\[-100, 100\]** that guarantees that the polynomial's evaluation is at the most **2 $ ^{63} $ – 1**.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 There will be multiple test cases, each one with **4** lines that are described below

**n**: degree of polynomial.

**c $ _{n} $ c $ _{n-1} $ … c $ _{2} $ c $ _{1} $ c $ _{0} $** : coefficients of the polynomial separated by a single space.

**k**: number of points to evaluate the polynomial.

**x $ _{1} $ x $ _{2} $ … $ _{} $ x $ _{k-1} $ x $ _{k} $** : points to evaluate the polynomial separated by a single space.

The final test case is a single line where **n = -1** and this case should not be processed.

### 输出格式

 For each test case you should print **k + 1** lines of output, the very first line containing the case number and the following **k** lines with the result of the polynomial's evaluation in each one of the **k** given points. See the sample.
