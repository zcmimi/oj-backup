# DCEPC703 - Totient Game

## 题目描述

Bahl and Debnath are always looking up for new exciting games on the internet. Yesterday, Bahl stumbled across a new game known as “Totient Game”. He immediately showed that to Debnath. They found it pretty exciting and decided to play it. The game is as follows:

1. The game is played with N piles of stones.

2. 2 players play alternatively and at each turn a player selects a pile and divides it into two unequal sized piles “i” and “j” such that Totient(i)\*Totient(j)=Totient(i\*j) and i+j = no. of stones in that pile.

3. The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.

Bahl insists on starting the game first. Can you predict the winner of the game? **Assume that both player plays optimally.**

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line gives T, the number of test cases.

Each test starts with a line containing “N”, the number of piles.

Next line gives N space separated integers. The i $ ^{th} $ integer represents the number of stones in the i $ ^{th} $ pile.

### 输出格式

Output T lines each containing the winner of the T games. Output “Bahl” if Bahl wins the game or “Debnath” if Debnath wins the game.
