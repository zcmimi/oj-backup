# SUBSHARD - Subset and upset (HARD)

## 题目描述

The whole world is crazy about subset sum. We define subset sum as sum of all subparts. A subpart is a number which is obtained by erasing certain digits and arranging the remaining numbers in the same order. You have to calculate the subset sum of the given number. Since the number can be very large return the subset sum modulo **m**.

For example if the number is 1357, then the various subparts are 1, 3, 5, 7, 13, 15, 17, 35, 37, 57, 137, 135, 157, 357, 1357 .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line contains **T**(1 T

Next T lines containing two numbers **n**(0 < **n** < 10 $ ^{1000} $ ) and **m**(1 < **m** < 10 $ ^{9} $ ).

### 输出格式

Print the subset sum modulo **m**.
