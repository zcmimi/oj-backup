# DISTANCE - Manhattan

## 题目描述

The L $ _{1} $ distance of two d-dimensional points is the sum of absolute values of their coordinate differences (i.e. Σ $ _{i=1} $ $ ^{d} $ |x $ _{i} $ - y $ _{i} $ | for two points x,y). Given N points in the plane you must find the farthest pair of points under the L $ _{1} $ distance metric and output their distance.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input is "N d" (2 ≤ N ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ d ≤ 6) signifying that there are N points in d-dimensional space. N lines then follow, where the ith line is a space-separated list of d numbers, the coordinates of the ith point. All given coordinates are integers that are at most 1000000 in absolute value, and all given points are distinct.

### 输出格式

Your output should consist of a single integer, the farthest distance between a pair of input points, followed by a newline.
