# MIB - Spelling Lists

## 题目描述

J, of the Men In Black, has been learning an alien language and has has a spelling test tomorrow. J, however, is bored of studying the nonsensical (and often unpronouncable) words.

Instead, he is seeing how many ways he can reorder his spelling list. After making all possible permutations of word on his list, he sorts the rearranged lists lexiographically (by the first word, then the second...). After the sort, in what position, with the lexiographically first list being in position 1, is his original spelling list?
