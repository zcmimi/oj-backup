## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains **T**, the number of test cases. **T** test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains **n** and **q**.

The second line of each test case contains **n** integers **(a1, a2, a3,..,an)**

Each of the next **q** lines contain **w, x, y, z**.

### 输出格式

For each test case output the result as given by the equation.

The answer may be very large, so output it **modulo 10^9+7**

**Constraints:**

1<= **T** 

1<= **n, q** 

1<= **x+i** <=n ( for all y<=i

0<= **ai** <=10^9 ( for all 1<=i

1<= **w** <=10^6

**0<=y<=z**
