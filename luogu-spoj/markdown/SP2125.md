# LABYR2 - Number Labyrinth

## 题目描述

Fred is a robotic mouse built by a group of students of artificial intelligence. Fred can move around in the labyrinth shown in the picture below. Whenever Fred comes to a place marked by a number, he has to choose one of the possible directions. Behavior of the mouse should look chaotic and complex enough so that it will impress students' supervisor.

```

+--------4

| |

| 8--9 |

| | | |

2--7--0 |

| | |

1 6-----+

```

Numbered places in the labyrinth are called nodes. Fred has one integer X stored in its memory and can perform some calculations. In each node (except node 1) he chooses a direction according to X, decreases X by 1 and goes to the chosen node. The direction is chosen according to this rules:

```

Node 2: Compute X mod 3.

If the result is 0, go to 7

1, go to 1

2, go to 4.

Node 4: Let Y be X written backwards (in decimal system).

If Y>X then go to 6 otherwise go to 2.

Node 6: Compute the number of digits of X (in decimal system).

If the result is even then go to 4 otherwise go to 7.

Node 7: Compute (X*X) mod 7.

If the result is 0 go to 2

1 go to 6

2 go to 8

4 go to 0.

Node 8: Compute X mod 5.

If the result is 2 or 3 then go to 7 otherwise go to 9.

Node 9: If you have come from 8 then go to 0.

If you have come from 0 then go to 8.

Node 0: Let Y be the third least significant digit of X in decimal system

(if X<100 then Y=0). If Y<=7 then go to 7 otherwise go to 9.

```

At the beginning of each experiment, the experimenter puts the mouse in the node 0 and initializes value X by voice. After that, the mouse starts to move. The mouse displays current value of X on its digital display. The experiment finishes when the mouse enters the node 1, the result of the experiment is the number displayed. If the value of X decreases to zero, the experiment fails and its result is -1.
