# GCJ2012C - Recycled Numbers

## 题目描述

Do you ever become frustrated with television because you keep seeing the same things, recycled over and over again? Well I personally don't care about television, but I do sometimes feel that way about numbers.

Let's say a pair of distinct positive integers (n, m) is recycled if you can obtain m by moving some digits from the back of n to the front without changing their order. For example, (12345, 34512) is a recycled pair since you can obtain 34512 by moving 345 from the end of 12345 to the front. Note that n and m must have the same number of digits in order to be a recycled pair. Neither n nor m can have leading zeros.

Given integers A and B with the same number of digits and no leading zeros, how many distinct recycled pairs (n, m) are there with A ≤ n < m ≤ B?

Limits

1 ≤ T ≤ 55

A and B have the same number of digits.

1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 2000000.

Are we sure about the output to Case #4?

Yes, we're sure about the output to Case #4.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of a single line containing the integers A and B.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the case number (starting from 1), and y is the number of recycled pairs (n, m) with A ≤ n < m ≤ B.
