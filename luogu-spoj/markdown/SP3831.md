### 题目描述

学生都很喜欢灌水，第一天只有Alice给她的每个朋友灌了一次水，从第二天开始，所有学生（包括Alice）将会有规律地去灌水：

　　1. 如果前一天被灌了奇数次的水，他们将会给每个朋友灌一次水；

　　2. 如果前一天被灌了偶数次的水，他们将会给每个朋友灌两次水。

　　学生编号为1到N，Alice为1号，学生之间的朋友关系会给出。

　　计算H天后一共灌了几次水。

### 输入格式

输入一行包含两个整数N和H(1<=N<=20,1<=H<=10^9)，表示学生数和天数。

接下来N行，每行包含N个‘0’或‘1’，（A,B）处的字符表示A和B的关系，‘1’表示是朋友关系，‘0’表示不是。注意自己和自己不是朋友关系，输入保证该矩阵是对称的。

### 输出格式

输出H天后一共灌水的数量。

## 题目描述

Children in school are having fun instead of listening to the teacher. With their iPhone devices the children throw watermelons at each other on the Facebook social site.

The game started when Goran threw one watermelon at each of his friends during the first class that day. During subsequent classes, all children (including Goran) behaved like this:

- If they had been hit by an odd number of watermelons during the previous class, they threw exactly one watermelon at each of their friends;

- If they had been hit by an even number of watermelons (including zero), then they hit each of their friends with two watermelons.

The children are numbered 1 through N, Goran obviously being number 1. The friend relationships between the children are also known.

Write a program that will calculate the total number of watermelons thrown after H classes.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers N and H (1 ≤ N ≤ 20, 1 ≤ H ≤ 1 000 000 000), the number of kids and classes.

Each of the following N lines contains a string of N characters '0' or '1'. The character (A, B) in this matrix is '1' if children A and B are friends.

No child will be their own friend. The input matrix will be symmetric

### 输出格式

Output the number of watermelons after H classes.
