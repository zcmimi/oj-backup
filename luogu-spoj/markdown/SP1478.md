# PT07B - The Easiest Problem

## 题目描述

You are given an unweighted, undirected tree _T_. We say _T_ is special iff it has this property:

"All nodes of degree greater than or equal to 3 are surrounded by at most two nodes of degree two or greater."

Finding maximal size subtree of this tree so that it's a special tree.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input file contains one integer _N_ --- number of nodes in the tree (0 < _N_ <= 10 $ ^{6} $ ). Next _N_-1 lines contain _N_-1 edges of that tree --- Each line contains a pair (_u_, _v_) means there is an edge between node _u_ and node _v_ (1 <= _u_, _v_ <= _N_).

### 输出格式

At the first line, output number of nodes in the optimal subtree you found. Next lines, print all edges belong to that subtree, each line contains a pair _u_ _v_ means an edge between node _u_ and node _v_.
