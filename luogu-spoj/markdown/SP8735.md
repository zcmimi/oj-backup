## 题目描述

Given any string of decimal digits, ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, there is always a decimal

number, which when cubed has a decimal expansion ending in the original given digit

string. The number need never have more digits than the given digit string.

Write a program, which takes as input a string of decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9

and finds a number of at most the same number of digits, which when cubed, ends in

the given digit string.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input begins with a line containing only the count of problem instances, nProb, as a

decimal integer, 1 <= nProb 

contains a string of between 1 and 10 decimal digits ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9.

### 输出格式

For each problem instance, there should be one line of output consisting of the number,

which when cubed, ends in the given digit string. The number should be output as a
