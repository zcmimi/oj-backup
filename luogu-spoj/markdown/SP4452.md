# ARITH2 - Simple Arithmetics II

## 题目描述

While browsing aimlessly, Peter stumbled upon an old riddle he used to solve on his calculator when he was still young. It was the kind of a riddle where you punch in a bunch of numbers and operators into a simple pocket calculator and then turn it upside down to get the answer:

_These come in many different sizes but they are always exactly one foot long. Answer: 103 \* 103 \* 5._

_What are made of ice to keep people warm? Answer: 50 \* 40 \* 250 + 791._

After a few minutes he found a large amount of such riddles and full of excitement he went to solve them. He turned his computer screen upside down...

... only to find out that he does not have a reasonable calculator program installed on his computer.
