# PIHU1 - Love Story 1

## 题目描述

Rancho is in love with Pihu. So on the Valentine’s Day they decided to spend time together at Assi Ghat, but Rancho, as we all know is very busy with his work, so he failed. It was now Pihu’s turn to go mad with anger. But there’s something which you can do.

Rancho tells Pihu that he is a novice programmer and is generally busy in solving problems at spoj. So Pihu decides to check his algorithmic skills. She puts forward an array of **N** integers. She gives him a number **P** and asks if he can find three (strictly three) integers **A $ _{i} $ A $ _{j} $ A $ _{k&nbsp;} $ ( i ≠ j ≠ k )** in the array, whose sum is equal to number **P**, i.e.

**A $ _{i} $ + A $ _{j} $ + A $ _{k&nbsp;} $ =P**.

Now, sooner Rancho answers her query in **YES** or **NO**, sooner he gets a kiss.
