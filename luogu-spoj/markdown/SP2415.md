# RESIST - Kirchhof Law

## 题目描述

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Multiple test cases. For each test case:

The first line contains integers N and M; N is a number of nodes in the circuit (2 < N <= 100), M is the number of resistors (0 <= M <= 300). Each of the next M lines consists of three integers A $ _{i} $ , B $ _{i} $ and R $ _{i} $ — description of a resistor that has resistance R $ _{i} $ connecting the nodes A $ _{i} $ and B $ _{i} $ (1 <= A $ _{i} $ , B $ _{i} $ <= N; 1 <= R $ _{i} $ <= 100).

There's a blank line between consecutive test cases in the input file. No other extra whitespace will/should be appear in the input/output.

Input terminates by EOF.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output the total resistance between the nodes 1 and N rounded within two digits after a decimal points. There won't be any test case the output for which is +INF.
