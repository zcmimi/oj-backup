# OPBIT - Operation Bits

## 题目描述

Operation bits - A new operation conducted by the secret team currently working on a project on security enhancement. Mr.Abay, the team head, has found a new pattern on the perfect squares. This can be used as a outer cover for his project as its securing power is low. So he assign you this problem to find the key based on the given conditions:

"An two adjacent perfect squares have their absolute difference as an odd number except when a and b are equal. Your task is to find the key which is deined as:

key(a,b) where a and b are perfect squares is ( ( AND( absolute difference betwen every adjacent perfect squares in \[a,b\]) ) AND ( XOR( absolute difference betwen every adjacent perfect squares in \[a,b\]) ) )"

Find the key for the given inputs :)

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input begins with a number T (1<=T<=1000) where T is the number of testcases.

T lines follow

Each line has two numbers a and b (0 < a <= b <= 10^6)

It is assured that a and b are perfect squares.

### 输出格式

For each test case print the corresponding key
