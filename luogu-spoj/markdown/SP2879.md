# DOCTOR - The Cow Doctor

## 题意翻译

##### 题目描述：

德克萨斯州是美国奶牛数量最多的州:根据美国国家农业统计局2005年的报告，德克萨斯州的奶牛数量为1380万头。这比排名第二的两个州的人口加起来还要多:堪萨斯州只有665万头奶牛，内布拉斯加州有635万头奶牛。（没啥用）

有几种疾病可以威胁一群牛因此，能够诊断某些疾病是非常重要的。幸运的是，有许多可用的测试药物可以用来检测这些疾病。

测试如下所示。首先从牛身上提取血液样本，然后将样本与测试材料混合。每种测试材料都能检测到一定数量的疾病。如果测试材料与患有上述任何一种疾病的血液样本混合，则会发生一种易于观察的反应。然而，如果一种检测材料可以检测出好几种疾病，那么我们就无法确定这些疾病中的哪一种存在于血液样本中，因为它们都产生相同的反应。有一些检测多种疾病的材料(这样的测试可以用来一次排除几种疾病)，也有一些检测几种疾病的测试(它们可以用来对问题做出准确的诊断)。

可以混合测试材料来创建新的测试。如果我们有检测疾病a和B的测试材料;还有另一个测试材料,检测疾病B和C,然后他们可以混合获得测试检测疾病,B和C,这意味着如果我们有这两个测试材料,然后是不需要测试的材料测试疾病,B, C-such材料可以获得bymixing这两个。

生产、分发和存储许多不同类型的测试材料是非常昂贵的，而且在大多数情况下是不必要的。你的任务是尽可能多地删除不必要的测试材料。它是这样做的，如果一个测试材料被淘汰，那么它应该是可能的混合从剩余的材料等效的测试。(“等效”的意思是，混合物测试的疾病与被排除的物质完全相同，不是更多，也不是更少)。

##### 输入输出格式

#### 输入格式:

输入包含几个测试用例块。每个病例都以一行包含两个整数开始:1号<= n <= 300种疾病，和1号<= m <= 200种测试材料。接下来的m行对应于m测试材料。每一行都以一个整数开始，这个数字1 <= k <= 300是材料可以检测到的疾病。然后是描述k种疾病的k个整数。这些整数在1和n之间。

输入被一个n = m = 0的块终止。

#### 输出格式:

对于每个测试用例，您必须输出包含单个整数的行:可以消除的测试材料的最大数量。

## 题目描述

Texas is the state having the largest number of cows in the US: according to the 2005 report of the NationalAgricultural Statistics Service, the bovine population of Texas is 13.8 million. This is higher than thepopulation of the two runner-up states combined: there are only 6.65 million cows in Kansas and 6.35millions cows in Nebraska.

There are several diseases that can threaten a herd of cows, the most feared being "Mad Cow Disease" or Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE); therefore, it is very important to be able to diagnose certain illnesses. Fortunately, there are many tests available that can be used to detect these diseases.

A test is performed as follows. First a blood sample is taken from the cow, then the sample is mixed with a test material. Each test material detects a certain number of diseases. If the test material is mixed with a blood sample having any of these diseases, then a reaction takes place that is easy to observe. However, if a test material can detect several diseases, then we have no way to decide which of these diseases is present in the blood sample as all of them produce the same reaction. There are materials that detect many diseases (such tests can be used to rule out several diseases at once) and there are tests thatdetect only a few diseases (they can be used to make an accurate diagnosis of the problem).

The test materials can be mixed to create new tests. If we have a test material that detects diseases A and B; and there is another test material that detects diseases B and C, then they can be mixed toobtain a test that detects diseases A, B, and C. This means that if we have these two test materials, then there is no need for a test material that tests diseases A, B, and C-such a material can be obtained bymixing these two.

Producing, distributing, and storing many different types of test materials is very expensive, and inmost cases, unnecessary. Your task is to eliminate as many unnecessary test materials as possible. Ithas to be done in such a way that if a test material is eliminated, then it should be possible to mix an equivalent test from the remaining materials. ("Equivalent" means that the mix tests exactly the samediseases as the eliminated material, not more, not less).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains several blocks of test cases. Each case begins with a line containing two integers: the number 1 <= n <= 300 of diseases, and the number 1 <= m <= 200 of test materials. The next m lines correspond to the m test materials. Each line begins with an integer, the number 1 <= k <= 300 of diseases that the material can detect. This is followed by k integers describing the k diseases. These integers are between 1 and n .

The input is terminated by a block with n = m = 0 .

### 输出格式

For each test case, you have to output a line containing a single integer: the maximum number of test materials that can be eliminated.
