Sadde being the king wanted to know the score of cities in his country. Sadde gives the task of scoring to one of his minister Dukker.

Each city consists of “N” buildings in a single row and each building is having a container in front of them. For each building in the city Dukker calculate the number of buildings having less height in left of that building(say **Hmin $ _{i} $** ) and number of buldings having greater height in right of that building(say **Hmax $ _{i} $** ). He put **Hmin $ _{i} $ + Hmax $ _{i} $** number of flags in container of **i $ ^{th} $** building.
