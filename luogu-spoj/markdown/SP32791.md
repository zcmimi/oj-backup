# BILLI - Billi and Kaddu

## 题目描述

Bubbleworld is in trouble and our wonderwoman, Billi needs to rescue the prince so as to save the kingdom from the wrath of the monster Kaddu. To do this, she needs to choose K words from a pot of M words she stole from Kaddu, and convert them to magical words, which she would use as a spell to break into the prison. She already knows N magical words.

The conversion of a stolen word to magical word requires the following operations :

1\) Remove a character from the end of the word, which incurs a cost of A coins

2\) Add a character to the end, which incurs a cost of B coins.

Help Billi save the kingdom by minimizing the cost required to convert exactly K stolen words to magical words.
