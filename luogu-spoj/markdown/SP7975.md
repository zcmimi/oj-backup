# ACPC10D - Tri graphs

## 题目描述

Here’s a simple graph problem: Find the shortest path from the top-middle vertex to the bottom-middle vertex in a given tri-graph. A tri-graph is an acyclic graph of (N >= 2) rows and exactly 3 columns. Unlike regular graphs, the costs in a tri-graph are associated with the vertices rather than the edges.

So, considering the example with N = 4, the cost of going straight down from the top to bottom along the middle vertices is 7 + 13 + 3 + 6 = 29. The layout of the directional edges in the graph are always the same as illustrated in the figure.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Your program will be tested on one or more test cases.

Each test case is specified using N + 1 lines where the first line specifies a single integer (2 The last case is followed by a line with a single zero.

### 输出格式

For each test case, print the following line:

k. n

Where k is the test case number (starting at one,) and n is the least cost to go from the top-middle vertex to the bottom-middle vertex.
