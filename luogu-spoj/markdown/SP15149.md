# POP3 - play with prime numbers (III)(hard )

## 题目描述

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

we define here a new prime number called prime of primes number (POP) is a prime number that consist of other prime numbers less than this number.

**example:**

1013 consist of 101 and 3 and both are primes.

**notes**:

2003 is not POP because leading zero not allowed.

The POP number must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping not allowed.
