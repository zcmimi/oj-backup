# RECTMAT - Rectangles in a Matrix

## 题目描述

In a matrix with n rows and m columns, (i,j) is the cell in i-th row and j-th column(0<=i<n,0<=j<m). A rectangle (r0,r1,c0,c1) in a matrix is the set of cells (i,j) where r0 <=i < r1 and c0 <=j < c1. (0<=r0 < r1 <=n, 0 <=c0 <c1 <=m). Two rectangles are called independent if the intersection of their cell set is empty. Given n,m,k, find the number of ways to choose k independent rectangles from a nxm matrix. The order of these k rectangles doesn't matter, see sample for further clarification.
