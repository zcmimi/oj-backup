# HS09GAME - Strategy game

## 题目描述

Julia and Robert are playing a game, in which they pick up sticks from heaps. The game starts with _n_ heaps, the _i_-th heap contains _a_\[_i_\] sticks. In each turn the players choose a heap and take away 2, 3 or 5 sticks from it (removed sticks do not return to the game). Julia starts the game making the first move. The one, who cannot make a move, loses the game, and the other player wins. Can you decide who will win the game, assuming that both players follow a perfect strategy ? If Julia is the winner, point out her winning move! If there are several possibilities for such a move, then choose the one in which the largest number of sticks is taken away. If there are still several such moves, choose the one, in which sticks are taken from the heap of the smallest number.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

An integer _T_, denoting the number of testcases (_T_ <= 1000). Each testcase contains one integer _n_, the number of heaps, followed by _n_ non-negative integers: _a_\[1\], _a_\[2\], ..., _a_\[_n_\], where _a_\[_i_\] is the number of sticks of the _i_-th heap.

Constraints:

1 <= _n_ <= 1000,

0 <= _a_\[_i_\] <= 1000000000.

### 输出格式

Please consult the example below for a specification of the required output format. Print a blank line after each testcase.
