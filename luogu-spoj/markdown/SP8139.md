# CHAIR - Chairs

## 题目描述

N chairs are placed in a circle.

There will be K attendants to a very important meeting.

However, the attendants do not like each other, so they do not want to sit beside each other in the meeting.

As the host of this important meeting, you want to find out how many ways there are to choose K chairs such that none of them are adjacent to each other.
