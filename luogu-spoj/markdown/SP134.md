# PHONY - Phony Primes

## 题目描述

 You are chief debugger for Poorly Guarded Privacy, Inc. One of the top selling product, ReallySecureAgent©, seems to have a problem with its prime number generator. It produces from time to time bogus primes N.

After a while, you realize that the problem is due to the way primes are recognized.

Every phony prime N you discover can be characterized as follows. It is odd and has distinct prime factors, say ![$ N = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_k$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/d5459190f42f572764402cf8af580b26e4f189da.png) with ![$ p_ine p_j$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/4132b2d1ba16f2fcbe5d8985076f6e21d4bd3969.png), where the number k of factors is at least 3. Moreover, for all i=1..k, ![$ p_i-1$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/b5eeaddf9ea9718ee06fcbb83948d8c4bc8bc276.png) divides N-1. For instance, 561 = 3\*11\*17 is a phony prime.

Intrigued by this phenomenon, you decide to write a program that enumerates all such N's in a given interval ![$ [N_{min},N_{max}[$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/75c74f181f15e4a459bd92414205efba38bbbbd5.png) with ![$ 1 le N_{min} &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; N_{max} &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 2^31, N_{max}-N_{min} &amp;amp;amp;amp;lt; 10^6$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/3d53ab4fcb0f01cfbc2be78c482384afc76bb0f6.png).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 Each test case contains one line. On this line are written two integers ![$ N_{min}$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/13ca0394b120c1897a49af38c570fb26da8d9a3e.png) and ![$ N_{max}$](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP134/c870e6474597e9b67b38b403469f35cc8a8f58af.png) separated by a blank. The end of the input is signalled by a line containing two zeros. The number of test cases is approximately 2000.

### 输出格式

 For each test case, output the list of phony primes in increasing order, one per line. If there are no phony primes in the interval, then simply output none on a line.
