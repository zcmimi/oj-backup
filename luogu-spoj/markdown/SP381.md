## 题目描述

In the movie "Blues Brothers", the orphanage where Elwood and Jake were raised may be sold to the Board of Education if they do not pay 5000 dollars in taxes at the Cook County Assessor's Office in Chicago. After playing a gig in the Palace Hotel ballroom to earn these 5000 dollars, they have to find a way to Chicago. However, this is not so easy as it sounds, since they are chased by the Police, a country band and a group of Nazis. Moreover, it is 106 miles to Chicago, it is dark and they are wearing sunglasses.

As they are on a mission from God, you should help them find the safest way to Chicago. In this problem, the safest way is considered to be the route which maximises the probability that they are not caught.
