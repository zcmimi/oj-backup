# WEAKSMK - Shoumiks Weakness

## 题目描述

Shoumik loves problem solving but he is weak in string related problems.

So he is practicing string related problems. But he thought that creating

a string related problem and solving that would be a great idea to be

strong in strings. So he thought of a problem.

Given a string S of N lower case alphabets how many distinct substrings T

are there with length L( L=|T| ) and S contains exactly X occurrences of T.

In the string S=“abcbcb” the substring T=“bcb” has length L=3 and S

has X=2 occurrences of T.(See hints for more clarification)

But as Shoumik is weak in string, he is stuck with this problem. You have

to help him answering Q queries for a given string S.

### Input

First line of input will contain the number of test cases Ts.

Then Ts test cases follows. Every test case contains two integers

N and Q in the first line. Next line will contain a string S, consisting of

N lower casecharacters. The next Q lines will contain Q queries with

two integers L,length of T for this query and X, Occurrences of T in S.

1<=Ts

1<=N

1<=Q

1<=L

0<=X

Sum of N over all test cases 

Number of queries Q over all test cases 

### Output

For every query print the number of distinct substrings T in the string S

which are of length L and have exactly X occurrences in S.

### Example

`Input:` ```

16 5abcbcb3 24 16 26 11 2

Output:

13011
