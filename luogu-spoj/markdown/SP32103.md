# TREEDEGREE - Degree of a Tree

## 题目描述

mrm\_196 always represents the rooted trees in a simple array, but the array holds four conditions:

1. If the tree has N vertices, the array has length 2N.

2. Each vertex has a number (from 1 to N) which is written twice (but they may not be necessarily beside each other).

3. Between the numbers of each vertex, the numbers on its subtree are written.

4. Vertex 1 is always the root of the tree.

For example, he may store the following tree in one of these six ways:

![Sample Tree](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP32103/6dafdfddc43aa86023d7c1e20e5865a6ad99dcf9.png)

Tree = {1, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5, 5, 3, 1}

Tree = {1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 5, 5, 3, 1}

Tree = {1, 3, 5, 5, 4, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1}

Tree = {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 1}

Tree = {1, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 2, 2, 3, 1}

Tree = {1, 3, 5, 5, 2, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1}

Your task is pretty simple, find what he always wanted, THE DEGREE OF THE TREE!!!!

Degree of a tree is the maximum degree of all its vertices.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains an integer _T_ (1 T

The first line of each test contains an integer _N_ (1 N

The second line of each test contains 2_N_ integers _a_ $ _{1} $ , _a_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _a $ _{2N} $_ (1 a $ _{i} $ N) — the elements of his array.

It’s guaranteed that the given array always forms at least one valid tree.

### 输出格式

For each test, print a single integer in one line — the degree of the tree.
