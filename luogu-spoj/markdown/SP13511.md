# KOSPC13B - Determine the vismin value !

## 题意翻译

班上有N名学生。老师想要以一种有趣的方式来测试学生的视力和思维敏锐度。她提出了一个想法。 学生被排成一排，编号从1到N，每个人拿着一个数字为K的棋盘。测试如下：老师叫出一个学生X;学生可以看着两边，并选择学生Y携带一个数量大于或等于X所携带的电路板数量的电路板，并计算出一个称为“vismin值”的值。 “vismin值”定义为X和Y的位置之差与X和Y所承载的最小的数字之间的乘积。如果不可能选择Y，则“vismin值”将为0现在，学生们测试的方式是学生能够最大化“视觉价值”。对于每个被调查的学生，他/她用“视觉价值”来回答。如果它最大，老师会说“最大”。如果有是一个更大的价值可能，老师说学生缺乏的价值，达到最大值。如果学生说的价值大于可能的最大值，老师说“不可能”。 考虑自己是老师，并相应地打印输出。

输入：

输入的第一行包含N，班级中的学生人数。 第二行由N个空格分隔的整数K组成，代表各个学生携带的板上的数字。 然后，每一行/查询由一个由学生确定的vismin值分隔的学生号码组成。 输入以学号和vismin值都等于0结束。

输出： 对于每个查询，打印教师会说的话

## 题目描述

 There are N students in a class. The teacher wants to test the acuity of the students' vision as well as mind in an entertaining way.She comes up with an idea.

The students were made to stand in a line and numbered from 1 to N, each carrying a board with a number K on it.The test is as follows : the teacher calls out a student X;the student can look at either sides and choose a student Y who carries a board with a number greater than or equal to the number on the board carried by X and calculates a value called as "vismin value". "vismin value" is defined as the product of the difference between the positions of X and Y and the smallest of the numbers on the boards carried by X and Y.If it is not possible to choose Y,"vismin value" will be 0. Now, the way the students are tested is how far the students maximise the "vismin value".For each student called, he/she answers with a "vismin value".If it is maximum, teacher says "Maximum".If there is a greater value possible, the teacher says the value which the student is running short of, to attain the maximum value.If the value said by the student is greater than the maximum value possible, the teacher says "Not possible".

Consider yourself as the teacher and print the output accordingly.

**Input:**

The first line of the input consists of N,the number of students in the class.

The second line consists of N space separated integers K representing the numbers on the boards carried by the respective students.

Then, each line/query consists of a student number separated by the vismin value determined by the student.

Input ends with both student number and vismin value equal to 0.

**Output:**

For each query, print what the teacher would have said.

****Constraints** :**

1<=N<=100000

1<=k<=10^9

Number of queries <= 10000

Input :
