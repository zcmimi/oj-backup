# BFMUL - Farmer Joe

## 题意翻译

## 题目翻译：

农民乔的确是个怪人。他拥有一种罕见的牛种，它吃巧克力并生产巧克力牛奶，每头牛都有L条腿。最近，乔的脚疼了，他的直觉告诉他，这一定是巧克力牛奶造成的。他怀疑，这些母牛在穿过马路时，由于踩着锋利的鹅卵石而感到疼痛。自然地，他们正在通过牛奶转移他们的痛苦。因此，他已经承担了自己的责任，为所有的人做适当的马蹄铁。他发现在象牙塔的顶端时，数他们的头数是最方便的。(每头牛只有一个头。)乔想知道他必须做多少鞋，因为他已经数了H头，事实上，他写一个程序，只是为了这个目的，但似乎找不到它。这个程序是用他在撰写图灵机论文时建造的一台特殊计算机编写的。他要求你帮忙更换他的计划。请尽快帮助他，这样他的母牛就能尽可能少地受苦。

## 题目描述

Farmer Joe is a strange fellow indeed. He owns a rare breed of cow that eats chocolate and produces chocolate milk, and each cow has exactly **L** legs. Lately, Joe has been suffering from sore feet, and his intuition tells him that it must be from the chocolate milk. The cows, he suspects, are in pain from stepping on sharp pebbles while crossing the road with chickens in their bare hooves. Naturally, they are transferring their pain karmically through the milk. So he has taken it upon himself to make proper hoofwear for all of them. As he lives at the top of an ivory tower, he finds it most convenient to count their heads. (Each cow has exactly one head.) Joe would like to know how many shoes he must make given that he has counted **H** heads, and in fact he wrote a program for just this purpose but can’t seem to find it. The program is written for a special computer that he constructed while he was writing his dissertation on Turing machines. He has asked for your help in replacing his program. Please help him quickly, so his cows can suffer as little as possible.

**Note:** You can use any programming language you want, as long as it is brainf\*\*k.
