# PAINTBLK - Painting Blocks (Act I)

## 题目描述

_n_ blocks are put in a line. You have _k_(1<=_k_<=15) kinds of dope, the _i_-th dope is enough to paint c $ _{i} $ (1<=c $ _{i} $ <=5) blocks. You may assume the sum of all the c $ _{i} $ equals to _n_. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to paint the blocks with these kinds of dope, such that no two adjacent blocks are painted with the same kind of dope.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

Ten test cases(given one after another, you have to process all!). For each test case, the first line contains an integer _k_, the second line contains _k_ integers, c $ _{1} $ , c $ _{2} $ , ...c $ _{k} $ .

### 输出格式

Ten lines, each contains an integer, the number of ways modulo 1000000007.
