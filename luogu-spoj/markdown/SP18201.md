# RKS - RK Sorting

## 题目描述

**RK** is a great code breaker. He knows any cipher in the world can be broken by frequency analysis. He intercepted an enemy message. The message consists of **N** numbers, smaller than or equal to **C**. RK belives freqency analysis consists of sorting this sequence so that more frequent numbers appear before less frequent ones.

Formally, the sequence must be sorted so that given any two numbers X and Y , X appears before Y if the number of times X appears in the original sequence is larger than the number of time Y does. If the number of appearances is equal, the number whoes value appears sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted sequence.

Help RK by creating a "frequency sorter".

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input contains two integers, N (1 <= N <= 1000), length of message, and C (1 <= C <= 10^9), the number from task description. Next line contains N integers smaller than or equal to C, message itself.

### 输出格式

First and only line of output should contain N numbers, the sorted sequence.
