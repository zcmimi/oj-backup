# MELE2 - ELEVATOR II

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/MELE2/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MELE2/vn/) ```

Edward works as an engineer for Non-trivial Elevators: Engineering,

Research and Construction (NEERC). His new task is to design a brand new

elevator for a skyscraper with h ﬂoors.

Edward has an idee ﬁxe: he thinks that four buttons are enough to control

the movement of the elevator.

His last proposal suggests the following four buttons:

• Move a ﬂoors up.

• Move b ﬂoors up.

• Move c ﬂoors up.

• Return to the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

Initially, the elevator is on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. A passenger uses the ﬁrst

three buttons to reach the ﬂoor she needs. If a passenger tries to move

a, b or c ﬂoors up and there is no such ﬂoor (she attempts to move

higher than the h-th ﬂoor), the elevator doesn’t move.

To prove his plan worthy, Edward wants to know how many ﬂoors are actually

accessible from the ﬁrst ﬂoor via his elevator. Help him calculate this number.
