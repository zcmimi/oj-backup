## 题意翻译

题目描述：

为了探索特殊数据结构的真正力量，两名冒险者pirate和duyhung123abc继续寻找新的挑战和越来越复杂的问题。但他们挣的钱并不多。他们非常的累，决定复习一下已经解决的问题，来看看到目前为止他们都遇到了些什么。突然，他们灵光一闪:“为什么不把他们中的一些合并成一个呢?”此时，QMAX3VN诞生了，就像火降临人类一样自然。

据说是在一个军营的早晨，所有的士兵都在排队准备晨操。但有一个很严峻的问题：他们没有同时起来！队列最初是空的。过了一会儿，一个士兵站了起来，匆忙地跑去加入队伍。而且，他们每个人都喜欢站在朋友的旁边，这样他们就会挤到现在队伍的某个位置。对于一个军营来说，这是多么混乱而且不可接受的场面啊!士兵们知道他们做了什么，准备接受惩罚。严格的指挥官决定给他们一个教训。每次他下命令(x,y)时，队伍中的所有士兵都必须大声说出站在x位置到y位置中间最高的人的海拔。惩罚在等着那些不正确地执行命令的人。院子里满是年轻士兵的忧虑。他们真的需要帮助!

输入格式：

第1行:整数n

第2行到第n+1行:每一行是以下两个事件之一:

A x y:一个士兵身高x刚刚进入线和自己挤到队列中y-1号位的后面。

Q x y:指挥官的命令。求出站在直线x到y位置的人的最高高度

输出格式:

对于指挥官的每一个命令，输出一行数字：所有士兵必须大声说出的数字。

## 题目描述

 [English](/problems/QMAX3VN/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/QMAX3VN/vn/)Following the journey to explore the real power of special data stuctures, two adventurers **_pirate_** and **_duyhung123abc_** continued to find new challenges with new more and more complicated problems. But what they earned was unremarkable. Being tired and stucked, they decided to review the problems they had solved to see what they had had so far. Suddenly, a mysterious light came to their mind: _"why not combine some of them into one !"_. And here, **QMAX3VN** was born, as natural as the way fire had come to humankind.

It is said that in a morning at a military camp. All soldiers were gathering in a line to prepare for morning excercises. But the problem was they did not get up simultaneously. The line was initially empty. After sometime, a soldier got up and ran hurrily to join the line. Also, each of them liked to stand near their friends so they would elbow themselves to some position of the current line. What a messy and unacceptable scene for a military camp! The soldiers knew what they had done and were ready to be punished. The strict commander decided to give them a lesson. Everytime he gave an **order(x,y)**, all soldiers in the line had to say loudly the height of **the highest man** among those were standing from position x to position y. Orders were made **continuously** since the first soldier entered the line. Punishment was waiting for whom would carried out the order incorrectly. The yard was full of worry from young soldiers. They really needed help !
