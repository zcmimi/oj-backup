## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of several test-cases separated by an empty line. The first line of each test-case holds the number of ingredients _N (1<=N<=50)_ the assistant bought followed by the number of recipes _R (1<=R<=100)_ in the chef’s repertoire. Each of the next lines contains exactly _N_ non-negative integers (no larger than 10 $ ^{6} $ ) informing about the ingredients. The first of these lines lists the quantities the assistant bought of each ingredient. The remaining _R_ lines list the quantities (in the same order as the previous line) necessary to make ten pancakes according to the recipe r $ _{i} $ (from 1 to _R_). The input ends on a test-case having both _N_ and _R_ zero, which must not be processed.

### 输出格式

Your program should produce one line per test-case containing the recipe that yields the largest number of pancakes followed by the number of entire pancakes that can be made then. If there is a tie, prefer the recipe that appears first in the input.
