# FIBFACT - Fibonacci Factor

## 题目描述

Let F(n) be nth fibonacci number. F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4) = 3 and so on. Given a positive integer n > 2, print the smallest prime number P such that P divides F(n) but it does not divide any F(k) smaller than F(n). Maximum value of n is limited by P where P < 2^64. You should print IMPOSSIBLE if no such P exists.

## 输入输出格式
