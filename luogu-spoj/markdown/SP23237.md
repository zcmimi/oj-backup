# FEAST - Feast Coins

## 题目描述

`Last feast the young princess received way too many coins. Since she is very young, she doesn't know the value of each coin, if you give her a coin with the value 5 or a coin with the value 1, she will consider them both as just 1 coin, regardless of the value. However, she can notice that the coin with value 5 doesn't look the same as the coin with value 1, and she will be happy if she has the same number of coins of each value. Otherwise, she will not be happy. She has a lot of coins of different values, and she needs some subset of these coins such that the sum of their values should be exactly S, and the number of coins of each value in this subset should be the same. Can you help her to count the number of different ways to do this?`
