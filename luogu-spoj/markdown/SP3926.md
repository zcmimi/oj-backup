## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MTEMP/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MTEMP/vn/) ```

There is a rectangular area containing n × m cells. Two cells are marked

with “2”, and another two with “3”. Some cells are occupied by obstacles.

You should connect the two “2”s and also the two “3”s with non-intersecting

lines. Lines can run only vertically or horizontally connecting centers

of cells without obstacles.

Lines cannot run on a cell with an obstacle. Only one line can run on

a cell at most once. Hence, a line cannot intersect with the other line,

nor with itself. Under these constraints, the total length of the two

lines should be minimized. The length of a line is defined as the

number of cell borders it passes. In particular, a line connecting cells

sharing their border has length 1.

Fig. 1(a) shows an example setting. Fig. 1(b) shows two lines satisfying the

constraints above with minimum total length 18.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

```

The input consists of multiple datasets, each in the following format.

n m

row1

…

rown

n is the number of rows which satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 9. m is the number of columns

which satisfies 2 ≤ m ≤ 9. Each rowi is a sequence of m digits separated by

a space. The digits mean the following.

0: Empty

1: Occupied by an obstacle

2: Marked with “2”

3: Marked with “3”

The end of the input is indicated with a line containing two zeros separated

by a space.

For each dataset, one line containing the minimum total length of the two

lines should be output. If there is no pair of lines satisfying the requirement,

answer “0” instead.
