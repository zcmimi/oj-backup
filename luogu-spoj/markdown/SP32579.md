# ADASUM - Ada and Expenses

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug has just returned from her trips. She noted all her expenses. Sadly, she only had a small piece of paper so she had to keep it in a compressed form. The compressed form is just a very long number. To restore the expenses, simply sum all contigous subsequences of the number. Since this number might be pretty big, you only have to output it modulo **10 $ ^{9} $ +7** (1000000007).

Can you help her to restore the number?
