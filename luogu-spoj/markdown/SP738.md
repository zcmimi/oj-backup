# TREE - Another Counting Problem

## 题目描述

Tree is an important data structure in Computer Science. Of all trees we work with, Binary Tree is probably the most popular one. A Binary Tree is called a **Strictly Binary Tree** if every nonleaf node in a binary tree has nonempty left and right subtrees. Let us define **a Strictly Binary Tree of depth d**, as a Strictly Binary Tree that has at least one root to leaf path of length **d**, and no root to leaf path in that tree is longer than **d**. So let us use a similar reasoning to define a generalized structure.

An n-ary Tree is called a **Strictly n-ary Tree** if every nonleaf node in an n-ary tree has n children each. A **Strictly n-ary Tree of depth d** can now be defined as a Strictly n-ary Tree that has at least one root to leaf path of length d, and no root to leaf path in that tree is longer than d.

Given the value of n and depth d, your task is to find the number of different strictly n-ary trees of depth d.

The figure below shows the 3 different strictly binary trees of depth 2.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 Input consists of several test cases. Each test case consists of two integers **n (0 < n <= 32), d (0 <= d <= 16)**. Input is terminated a test case where n=0 and d=0, you must not process this test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case, print three integers, n, d and the number of different strictly n-ary trees of level d, in a single line. There will be a single space in between two integers of a line. You can assume that you would not be asked about cases where you had to consider trees that may have more than 2 $ ^{10} $ nodes in a level of the tree. You may also find it useful to know that the answer for each test case will always fit in a 200 digit integer.
