# ADAJOBS - Ada and Jobs

## 题意翻译

有一个空的列表，现在对这个列表进行如下操作：

1. 插入，在列表中插入一个字符串（序号为0）

2. 查询，查询列表中是否有一个字符串，使查询的字符串是该字符串的子串，如果是则输出YES，否则输出NO（序号为1）

- 现在请你编写一个程序，完成这些操作。

- 输入的第一行是操作总数Q(Q<10^6)。下面Q行，每行一个数字和一个字符串。数字是操作类型（0或1），字符串是要操作的字符串。

- 输出包含若干行，对于输入的每个查询操作，输出YES或NO。

## 题目描述

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug has a huge TODO-list. Sometimes she inserts a new job into her TODO-list and sometimes she is wondering whether there is a job (in her TODO-list), which she wants to do now. She doesn't require the whole job to be there, perhaps just a part of it.

Can you create a program which would serve her? That means it either inserts a new job into her TODO-list or answers whether there exists a word (in her TODO-list) which is a substring of given word.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input containts **Q**, the number of queries.

The next **Q** lines contains a number **0 and nonempty string **s**. If **t** is equal to 0 then it is inserion query, otherwise it is question query. **s** consists of lowercase characters only.**

The sum of lengths of queries of both types doesn't exceed **10 $ ^{6} $** (that means the total sum of lengths of strings will be at most **2\*10 $ ^{6} $** )

**NOTE:** All newly added jobs will be distinct.

### 输出格式

For each query of type **1**, print either **YES**, if there is already a substring in the TODO-list and **NO** otherwise.
