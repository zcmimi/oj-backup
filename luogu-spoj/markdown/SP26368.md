## 题目描述

 Exponentiation is a mathematical operation, written as _b $ ^{n} $_ , involving two numbers, the base _b_ and the exponent _n_. When _n_ is a positive integer, exponentiation corresponds to repeated multiplication of the base: that is, _b $ ^{n} $_ is the product of multiplying _n_ bases:

_b $ ^{n} $_ = b x b x b x .......... x b

In computing, the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another (sometimes called _modulus_). Given two positive numbers, _a_ (the dividend) and _n_ (the divisor), _a_ modulo _n_ (abbreviated as _a_ mod _n_) is the remainder of the Euclidean division of _a_ by _n_. For instance, the expression "5 mod 2" would evaluate to 1 because 5 divided by 2 leaves a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1, while "9 mod 3" would evaluate to 0 because the division of 9 by 3 has a quotient of 3 and leaves a remainder of 0; there is nothing to subtract from 9 after multiplying 3 times 3.

Now, you are given the value of a,b and m. print the value of **a $ ^{b} $ mod m**
