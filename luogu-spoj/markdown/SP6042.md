# QCJ2 - Another Box Problem

## 题目描述

There are N numbered boxes placed on a table, let Bi denote the ith box in the line. Write a program that finds the total number of ways to place N identical balls such that atmost k balls are present in the boxes B1, .... ,Bk for 1<=k<=N. Since the number can be quite large you are supposed to output the answer modulo 761238923.
