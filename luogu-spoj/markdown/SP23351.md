Hiccup does not want Dragons to fight so he comes up with a new strategy to select the required group of Dragons. He tells the villagers the he had a dream last night in which his father told him that a group of dragons will be lucky for the village if following two conditions are satisfied:

1\) There are at least two dragons in the group.
