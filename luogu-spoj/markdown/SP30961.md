# COPSEQH - Non Coprime Sequences(Hard)

## 题目描述

Define **F(n,m)** to be the number of sequences of length **n** which satisfy:

- All elements of the sequence are positive divisors of **m**

- For any two adjacent elements, say p and q, there exists at least one prime which divides both of them.

You are given two integers, n and m. Find the values of **F(1,m), F(2,m), ... ,F(n,m)** modulo **10 $ ^{9} $ +7**

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line of input contains two integers, n and m.
