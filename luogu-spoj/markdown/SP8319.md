# GLJIVE - GLJIVE

## 题目描述

 In front of Super Mario there are **10 mushrooms**, arranged in a row. A certain amount of points is awarded for picking each of the mushrooms. Super Mario must pick mushrooms **in order** they appear, but is not required to pick them all – his goal is to score a number of points **as close as possible to 100**.

In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 100 (e.g. 98 and 102), Mario will pick the **greater** one (in this case 102).

Help Super Mario and tell him how many points he will score.
