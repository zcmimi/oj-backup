# BITMAP - Bitmap

## 题意翻译

一个m*n的矩阵由0和1组成，求出每一格与最近的1的距离，距离定义为横坐标之差的绝对值与纵坐标之差的绝对值之和。每个测试数据包括多个样例。

## 题目描述

 There is given a rectangular bitmap of size _n\*m_. Each pixel of the bitmap is either white or black, but at least one is white. The pixel in _i_-th line and _j_-th column is called the pixel (_i,j_). The distance between two pixels **p $ _{1} $** =(_i $ _{1} $ ,j $ _{1} $_ ) and **p $ _{2} $** =(_i $ _{2} $ ,j $ _{2} $_ ) is defined as:

d(**p $ _{1} $** ,**p $ _{2} $** )=|_i $ _{1} $ -i $ _{2} $_ |+|_j $ _{1} $ -j $ _{2} $_ |.

### Task

Write a program which:

- reads the description of the bitmap from the standard input,

- for each pixel, computes the distance to the nearest white pixel,

- writes the results to the standard output.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line. In the first line of each test case there is a pair of integer numbers _n, m_ separated by a single space, _1<=n <=182_, _1<=m<=182_. In each of the following _n_ lines of the test case exactly one zero-one word of length _m,_ the description of one line of the bitmap, is written. On the _j_-th position in the line (_i+1_), _1 <= i <= n_, _1 <= j <= m_, is '1' if, and only if the pixel (_i,j_) is white.

### 输出格式

 In the _i_-th line for each test case, _1<=i<=n_, there should be written _m_ integers f(_i,1_),...,f(_i,m_) separated by single spaces, where f(_i,j_) is the distance from the pixel (_i,j_) to the nearest white pixel.
