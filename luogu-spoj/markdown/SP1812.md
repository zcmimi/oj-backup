## 题意翻译

题面描述

给定一些字符串，求出它们的最长公共子串

输入格式

输入至多$10$ 行，每行包含不超过$100000$ 个的小写字母，表示一个字符串

输出格式

一个数，最长公共子串的长度

若不存在最长公共子串，请输出$0$ 。

## 题目描述

A string is finite sequence of characters over a non-empty finite set Σ.

In this problem, Σ is the set of lowercase letters.

Substring, also called factor, is a consecutive sequence of characters occurrences at least once in a string.

Now your task is a bit harder, for some given strings, find the length of the longest common substring of them.

Here common substring means a substring of two or more strings.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains at most 10 lines, each line consists of no more than 100000 lowercase letters, representing a string.
