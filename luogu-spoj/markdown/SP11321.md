For example if the books are arranged in the order below

2 3 1 7 4 5 6

he can make it sorted by removing '1' and placing it at the beginning and then removing '7' and placing it in the end.

Since the book shelf can be very big and can have large number of books He needs your help to tell him the minimum remove and place operations he needs to do.
