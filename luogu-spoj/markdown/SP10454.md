# GREENLAN - Greens Land

## 题目描述

Mr. Green has a large portion of land divided into square units that are either field or lake areas.

He wants to fence a rectangular portion of his lands to use for livestock.

The lake areas have a very soft soil and any fence built near those areas have a chance to fall (and

then the animals could escape), so no fence should be built near a lake area.

Mr. Green wants to know of how many ways he can fence a rectangular area of his lands without

any portion of the fence having a common border with a lake area.

In the example above, for a 3x3 land with a lake area in the center, we have 5 possibilities of fence.
