# PRHYME - Perfect Rhyme

## 题目描述

```

A perfect rhyme is not a crime,

it is something that exceeds time,

a bit of science, a piece of art,

soft as a pillow, sharp as a dart.

```

Everyone tried it, but only few chosen ones succeeded. It is a hard task with an unclear path, but a famous end – should you reach it. Many compare it to finding the Holy Grail, or even to finding Waldo. The task is to find a perfect rhyme.
