# STAVATAR - The Last String Bender

## 题目描述

The charland nation has declared a war on all nations. To defeat the charlord stavatar has to meet his previous stavatar form(stoku) in the char temple for some guidance. To open the char temple one has to enter two passwords simulatenously.

The charland benders knew that this would happen some day and they modified the password to char temple with a special charland bending technique.

The special charland bending technique is swapping the characters between two strings(passwords) of length N from L to R in their respective positions(Inclusive).

for example a typical special charland bending technique on the below strings(L=2 and R=4)

`abcdef ghijkl`

transforms them to

` abijkf ghcdel `

now the stavatar has successfuly robbed the records(scroles) of these modifications to the passwords. but a little bit confused on how to obtain the original passwords. can you help him ??
