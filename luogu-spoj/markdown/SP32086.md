# TPGA - The Permutation Game Again

## 题意翻译

### 题意

有一类数组，满足以下条件：假设它的长度为$len$，则正整数$1 \dots len$在其中有且只有一个（全排列）。

给你一个正整数$n$以及一个长度为$n$的这类数组$arr$。在所有长度为$n$的这类数组中，求$arr$按字典序的排名。

### 输入

首先一个数$T$，表示数据组数，接下来有$T$组数据。

每组数据先是一个数$n$。接下来$n$个数，表示$arr_{1 \dots n}$。

### 输出

对于每一组数据，输出所求的排名模$1000000007$的值。

### 样例

```cpp

Input:

3

1

1

3

3 2 1

4

2 1 4 3

Output:

1

6

8

```

### 数据范围

$1<=T<=10,1<=n<=200000$

## 题目描述

Since YoMamaSoFat was able to answer Blackhood's and Kira's question as in http://www.spoj.com/problems/TPGAME/ (though with a little help from your side), it was my turn to ask him a question. This would again be a coding question as you might be knowing he is a noob in coding. I gave him a permutation of N distinct integers from 1...N and asked him the rank of the permutation when all possible permutations of the integers are arranged lexicographically. eg for N=3, all possible permutations arranged lexicographically would be:-

1 2 3

1 3 2

2 1 3

2 3 1

3 1 2

3 2 1

From the above, rank of 1 2 3 would be 1, rank of 1 3 2 would be 2 and so on...

**HELP HIM!**

**NOTE:- You may assume it is the same permutation which Blackhood gave him in http://www.spoj.com/problems/TPGAME/ to tell the no. of inversions for each integer in it.![Wink](../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif "Wink")**
