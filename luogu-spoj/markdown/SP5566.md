# BSMATH2 - Math with Bases

## 题目描述

With [your previous help](../BSMATH1/), Little Ben managed to get a perfect score on his homework. He came running home to show his brother, Big Ben. Big Ben had done this type of thing before, you see, so he naturally wasn't too impressed. Big Ben boasted, "Back in my day, we had to multiply and divide as well, the numbers were much bigger, AND we had to do it in base 64."

Little Ben became intrigued by this and searched the Internet for a worksheet. It turns out that his teacher made a worksheet for one of the higher grades that was just like Big Ben's. She also forgot to write what base each question was in... again!

According to the worksheet,

The digits used for Base 64 are the same as that of Base 62, with the single- and double-quotes as the last two; the digits used are 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'".

**Input**

The first line of input contains an integer `n` (1 < n < 64) that indicates the amount of sections (test cases). Each test case is as follows:

```

A - B = C

I

X1 op Y1 =

X2 op Y2 =

...

XI op YI =

```

where `A - B = C` is the correct example, `I` (1 Xi and `Yi` are the operands of each problem (0 < X, Y op is one of

\[+, -, \*, %\], denoting addition, subtraction, multiplication, or modulo.

**Output**

Your program should output in the following format:

```

SECTION 1 (BASE b)

X1 op Y1 = Z1

X2 op Y2 = Z2

...

Xi op Yi = Zi

SECTION 2 (BASE b)

X1 op Y1 = Z1

X2 op Y2 = Z2

...

Xi op Yi = Zi

...

SECTION N (BASE b)

X1 op Y1 = Z1

X2 op Y2 = Z2

...

Xi op Yi = Zi

```

where `Zi` is the solution to `Xi op Yi`, and `b` is the base used. (2 If the base is ambiguous, use the smallest base for which the example is correct and the questions are valid.

**Example**

**Input:**

```

4

K72Q - 9C5U = APRR

3

11JH4 - BMEB =

PB04 % DQ9O =

F0GM - UQR0 =

A654A - 9A60E = AE3B

2

B94BA + 3460A =

123A29 % 5E065 =

37CR - olh = 2KSm

5

157W % 1bIJ =

1P56 % 1Eob =

1C6I * 1"uX =

1Ktc % 1BMf =

20ne * 22V" =

BQfC - 4Kdb = 761H

2

9aFL * 3WU3 =

5fcV + 7fWL =

```

**Output:**

 ```

SECTION 1 (BASE 31)

  11JH4 - BMEB = KS2O

  PB04 % DQ9O = BFLB

  F0GM - UQR0 = -FQA9

SECTION 2 (BASE 15)

  B94BA + 3460A = EDAC5

  123A29 % 5E065 = 5594E

SECTION 3 (BASE 64)

  157W % 1bIJ = 157W

  1P56 % 1Eob = AIX

  1C6I * 1"uX = 2O3gS"I

  1Ktc % 1BMf = 9Wz

  20ne * 22V" = 46bA3EO

SECTION 4 (BASE 42)

  9aFL * 3WU3 = bBafS4L

  5fcV + 7fWL = DfTA

```
