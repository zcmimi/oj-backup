# TUPLEDIV - Tuple Division

## 题目描述

**Description**

You are given N tuples with M dimensions. You need to choose some tuples and divide them into M groups. Each tuple can be used for only once and the size of the i $ ^{th} $ group is C $ _{i} $ . We define the score of the i $ ^{th} $ group is the sum of value in the i $ ^{th} $ dimension of the tuples in the i $ ^{th} $ group. Your target is to firstly maximize the score of 1 $ ^{th} $ group, then maximize the score 2 $ ^{th} $ group and so on.

**Input**

The first line of the input contains an integer T(T

**Output**

For each test case, print one line with M score of some optimal division.

**Sample Input**

2

4 2

2 1

3 2

2 1

2 2

1 1

4 3

1 1 2

8 7 1

8 7 2

8 7 4

8 2 3

**Sample Output**

5 2

8 7 7

**Hint**

In case 2, we can dive the group like:

Group 1: (8, 7, 2) score = 8

Group 2: (8, 7, 1) score = 7

Group 3: (8, 7, 4), (8, 2, 3) score = 4 + 3 = 7
