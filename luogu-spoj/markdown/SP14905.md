# ZIGZAG2 - Zig when you zag

## 题目描述

We say that a sequence of numbers x(1),x(2),...,x(k) is zigzag if no three of its consecutive elements create a nonincreasing or nondecreasing sequence. More precisely, for all i=1,2,...,k-2 either x(i+1)x(i),x(i+2).

You are given two sequences of numbers a(1),a(2),...,a(n) and b(1),b(2),...,b(m). The problem is to compute the length of their longest common zigzag subsequence. In other words, you're going to delete elements from the two sequences so that they are equal, and so that they're a zigzag sequence. If the minimum number of elements required to do this is k then your answer is m+n-2k.
