# TREEISO - Tree Isomorphism

## 题目描述

Given two undirected trees T1 and T2 with equal number of vertices N (1

Two trees T1 and T2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection f between the vertex sets of T1 and T2 such that any two vertices u and v of T1 are adjacent in T1 if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in T2.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains the number of test cases nTest (1<= nTest <= 400). Each test case contains:

- The first line contains the number of nodes N.

- Each of next N-1 lines contain two integers A, B, denoting that there is an edge in T1 between nodes A and B (1

- Each of next N-1 lines contain two integers A, B, denoting that there is an edge in T2 between nodes A and B (1

The sum of N over all test cases will not exceed 100,000.

### 输出格式

For each test case print YES if T1 and T2 are isomorphic and NO otherwise.
