# COPSEQ - Non Coprime Sequences

## 题目描述

You are given two integers, **n** and **m**.

Find and print the number of sequences of length n which satisfy:

- All elements of the sequence are positive divisors of m

- For any two adjacent elements, say p and q, there exists at least one prime which divides both of them.

Print the number of such sequences modulo 10 $ ^{9} $ +7
