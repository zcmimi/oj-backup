# DCEPC705 - Weird Points

## 题目描述

Given N distinct points in a plane, a point (x1, y1) is said to be dominating another point (x2, y2) if x1>=x2 and y1>=y2.

The Dominance of a point is the absolute difference between 2 quantities – no. of points dominated by this point and no. of points not dominated by this point. **(excluding itself)**

A Weird point is the point whose Dominance value is greater than or equal to a threshold value ‘k’. Find the no. of such Weird Points among those N given points.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line gives T, the no. of test cases.

Each test case consists of 2 integers in first line, N and K, as specified above.

Next N lines give the coordinates of N points in the plane. “Xi” and “Yi” are space separated.

### 输出格式

Output T lines, each containing the required answer.
