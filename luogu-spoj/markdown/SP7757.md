# MFLAR10 - Flowers Flourish from France

## 题目描述

 Fiona has always loved poetry, and recently she discovered a fascinating poetical form. Tautograms are a special case alliteration, which is the occurrence of the same letter at the beginning of adjacent words. In particular, a sentence is a tautogram if all of its words start with the same letter.

For instance, the following sentences are tautograms:

- Flowers Flourish from France

- Sam Simmonds speaks softly

- Peter pIckEd pePPers

- truly tautograms triumph

Fiona wants to dazzle her boyfriend with a romantic letter full of this kind of sentences. Please help Fiona to check if each sentence she wrote down is a tautogram or not.
