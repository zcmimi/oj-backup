# GCDEX - GCD Extreme

## 题意翻译

给出n,求所有gcd(i,j)之和,其中1<=i<j<=n. 不超过20000组数据,n<=1000000. 感谢@Fuko_Ibuki 提供的翻译

## 题目描述

Given the value of N, you will have to find the value of G. The meaning of G is given in the following code

```

G=0;

for(i = 1 ; i < N ; i++)

for(j = i+1 ; j <= N ; j++)

G+=gcd(i,j);

```

Here gcd() is a function that finds the greatest common divisor of the two input numbers.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input file contains at most 20000 lines of inputs. Each line contains an integer N (1 < N < 1000001). The meaning of N is given in the problem statement. Input is terminated by a line containing a single zero.

### 输出格式

For each line of input produce one line of output. This line contains the value of G for the corresponding N. The value of G will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.
