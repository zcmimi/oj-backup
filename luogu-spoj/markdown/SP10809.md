## 题意翻译

给定一个函数$f$, 它的取值如下:

- $f(0) = 1$

- $f(1) = 1$

- $f(2) = 1$

- $f(n) = (\prod ^ n _ {i = 1} i\ [i ∈ Prime][2 ∤ i])$ $(n ≤ 10)$

(上面的说人话讲就是所有小于n的奇素数之积)

- $f(n) = 2 ^ {f(\lceil \frac n 4 \rceil)}f(\lceil \frac n 5 \rceil) f(\lceil \frac n {10} \rceil)$ $(n > 10)$

输入共有$T$ 组数据. $(T ≤ 10)$

每组数据将给你一个$N$ $(N ≤ 10^6)$

你需要求出$a$和$b$ $(a, b ≤ 5 * f(N))$的值

使得$gcd(a, b) = N$, 且$a ^ b\ mod\ 10^9 + 7$的值最大

输出$a ^ b \ mod\ 10 ^ 9 + 7$的值.

## 题目描述

Vaibhav loves playing with numbers. To enjoy his summer holidays he decides to join the group "number players" of his school. He decides to visit the group hall. At the gate he finds a lock and a paper. The gate can only be unlocked by solving the puzzle written on the paper. Vaibhav is stuck with his puzzle, help him in solving it.

Here is the puzzle description:

Given a sequence F(N)

F(0)=1

F(1)=1

F(2)=1

F(n) = product of all odd primes less than or equal to n (for n<=10)

F(n) = (2^(n/4)) \* F(n/5)\* F(n/10) (for n>10)

**For every fraction , a ceil value is taken for evaluation.**

**For eg. F(11)=2^ceil(11/4) \* F(ceil(11/5)) \* F(ceil(11/10)) = 2^3 \* F(3) \* F(2) = 24**

Given N. Find the max value of **(a^b)%mod** such that a and b satisfies the relation gcd(a,b) = F(N).

Gcd : Greatest common divisor
