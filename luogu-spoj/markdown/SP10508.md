# BTTNS - Buttons

## 题目描述

Luis has a new toy, is a weird board with NxM cells. The cells can be white or

black.

Each cell has a button inside, when you press a button every cell with Manhattan

distance equal or less than K to the cell with the button pressed change of color

( white to black, or black to white ).

At the beginning, every cell is white but somebody pressed some buttons and now

the board has some black cells.

You can assume that no button will be pressed two or more times.

There will be always only one configuration of buttons pressed that generate the

final board.
