## 题意翻译

一个小城里有许多不同高度的大楼，所有的楼都在一条线上面。现在要找到这些大楼的一个子序列的最大可能长度，要求这个子序列中，大楼的高度先单调增长，然后单调减少。

输入：第一行一个整数T，表示有T组数据。接下来的T组数据。每个数据的第一行是一个整数N，表示有多少大楼，接下来一整行是N个整数，即A1,A2,A3......An，表示Ai第i个大楼的高度。

输出：每一组数据都有一个输出，即是这个子序列的最大长度。

数据范围：1<=T<=100，1<=N<=1000，1<=Ai<=100

## 题目描述

Mr Durgeshwara was very impressed by Rahul.But now he was in trouble.He has already fixed his daughter's marriage with Thangabali who was the best coder of his town. He got an idea and arranged a contest between Rahul and Thangabali.They have to solve a problem at the same time and whoever solves first will marry Meenamma. Rahul was not such a good coder and was also getting help from Meenamma.Your task is to help Thangabali to solve the problem to create a twist in story .

The problem was that there are large number of builing in the town which are of different heights and all the building are in a single line.

You have to find the maximum possible length of the subsequences of buildings which are possible which are first increasing in heights and then decreasing! Please Note: the heights of the building in the subsequences should be strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing

**Input Specification:**

First line contains an integer T( 1 < = T < = 100) that represents the number of test cases.Then follows the T containg the integer N(1 < = N < = 1000) specifying the total number of elements and the next line contains the N integers A1,A2,A3...An (1<= Ai< = 1000)

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print only one line, the maximum length of such sequence.

**Sample input:**

2

10

1 3 5 6 4 8 4 3 2 1

6

8 6 3 4 2 1

**Sample Output:**

9

5

**Explanation**

for first test case the subsequence is : 1 3 5 6 8 4 3 2 1 for second case it is : 8 6 4 2 1
