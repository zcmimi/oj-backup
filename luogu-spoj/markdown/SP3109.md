# STRLCP - Longest Common Prefix

## 题目描述

The LCP (Longest Common Prefix) of two strings A\[1..la\] and B\[1..lb\] is defined as follows:

LCP(A\[1..la\],B\[1..lb\]) = max{L | L<=la && L<=lb && A\[1..L\] == B\[1..L\]}

Given an original string and several operations, you should write a program to process all the operations.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line will be number of test cases T.

The first line of each test case is a string S with length L (1 <= L <= 100000).

The second line contains an integer Q(1 <= Q <= 150000), representing the number of operations.

Each of the following Q lines represents an operation:

Q i j: print LCP(S\[i..L\], S\[j..L\])

R i char: replace the i-th character of S with char

I i char: insert character char after the i-th character of S

### 输出格式

For each "Q i j" operation, print the answer.
