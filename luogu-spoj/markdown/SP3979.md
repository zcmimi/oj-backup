## 题目描述

[English](/problems/MZVRK/en/) [Vietnamese](/problems/MZVRK/vn/) By removing all digits left of the rightmost digit one in the binary representation of some integer, we get what is called the "whirligig" of that number. For example, the whirligig of 6 i.e. (110)2 is 2 i.e. (10)2, and the whirligigof 40 i.e. (101000)2 is 8 i.e. (1000)2. Write a program that will calculate the sum of the whirligig of all numbers between two given numbers A and B (inclusive).
