# SPCM - Gopu and function

## 题目描述

Once Gopu was reading a maths problem which had a weird looking function f as follows.

{

1, if n is a prime number.

**f(n) =** f (sum of prime divisors of n) + number of distinct prime divisors of n, otherwise.

}

Compute f (n) for a given value of n.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

For each test case, there is a single line containing integer n. (2 <= n <= 10^12).

### 输出格式

For each test case, output value of f (n) in a single line.
