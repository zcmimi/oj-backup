# ADABLOOM - Ada and Bloom

## 题目描述

As you might already know, Ada the Ladybug is a farmer. She grows many beautiful flowers. Each of the flowers has something called "blooming value". As long as **A $ _{i} $ < A $ _{i} $** ⊕ **A $ _{j} $ < A $ _{j} $** (where ⊕ stands for binary XOR, and **A** stands for "blooming value") is true for any pair of flowers (in any order), then those flowers-pair might bloom into a wonderful blossom, if they are replanted into same box (at most 2 flowers can be put into one box).

Ada wants to maximize the number of blossoms - can you find it?
