# KOPC12H - K12-OE Numbers

## 题目描述

 Rishi loves numbers and number patterns very much. He is interested in finding OE numbers in a range \[a, b\]. An OE number is a number whose sum of even digits \[0, 2, 4, 6, 8\] is greater than sum of odd digits \[1, 3, 5, 7, 9\]. Help him to count how many OE numbers are in range \[a, b\] { a and b inclusive }

```

Example:

- 4563: O = 5+3 = 8, E = 4+6 = 10, E > O, so 4563 is an OE number

- 1233, O = 1+3+3 = 7, E = 2,    E < O, so 1233 is not an OE number

- 10, O = 1, E = 0       E < O, so 10 is not an OE number

```

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of the input file contains **T** which denotes the number of Test cases. The next **T** lines contains two space seperated integers **a** and **b**.

1 <= **a** <= **b** <=10^8

**T** <= 35.

### 输出格式

 Print the number of OE numbers in range \[**a**, **b**\] {one number per line}
