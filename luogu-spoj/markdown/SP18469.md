The desks are up against the wall, in a single line, so it's possible that Dr. Baws will have to leave some desks empty. He does know which students are friends, and fortunately the list is not so long: it turns out that for any subset of $ K $ graduate students, there are at most $ K-1 $ pairs of friends. Dr. Baws would like you to minimize the total number of desks required. What is this minimum number?
