# MSET - Make Sets

## 题目描述

For a given number **N** you have **K** copies of each number from 1 to N. Therefore, you have a total of **N\*K** numbers. You need to form **M** sets **s1 ,s2 ,s3 , .... sm** where a set should contain unique numbers(set may be empty).

Now, let D be the sum of size of all M sets.(where the size of a set is number of elements in it)

Let **G(i)**= number of ways to form M sets such that D is equal to i.

Find **G(0)+ G(1) +...... G(N\*K)** modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note: Ordering of sets matters as the sets are numbered.

**For eg:**

N=2, M=2, K=2

So, the numbers present initially are (1,1,2,2)

G(0)=1,

{ } ,{ }

G(1)=4,

{1}, { }

{2},{ }

{ }, {1}

{ },{2}

G(2)=6,

{1},{2}

{2},{1}

{1},{1}

{2},{2}

{1,2} , { }

{ },{1,2}

G(3)=4,

{1,2},{1}

{1,2},{2}

{1}, {1,2}

{2}, {1,2}

G(4)=1,

{1,2}, {1,2}

{ } represents empty set.

So answer = G(0)+G(1)+G(2)+G(3)+G(4) = 16

**Input Specification** First line of input consists of integer t denoting number of test cases.

Each of the next t lines contain 3 integers N, M , K where N>=M>=K

**Output Specification** Output consists of t lines. Each line contains the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Constraint**

1<=t<=100

1<=M<=N<=100000

0<=K<=M
