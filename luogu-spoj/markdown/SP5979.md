# YAPP - Yet Another Permutations Problem

## 题目描述

How many permutations of the first N numbers exist such that the maximum element between the indices \[i..j\] is either present at index i, or at index j ?

**Input**

The first line contains the number of test cases T. Each of the next T lines contains an integer N

**Output**

Output T lines containing the required answer for the corresponding test case. Since the answers can get really big, output the result modulo 1000000007.

**Example**

```

Sample Input:

1

2

Sample Output:

2

```

**Constraints**

1 <= T <= 10000

1 <= N <= 1000000000
