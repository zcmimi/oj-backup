# BOOKS1 - Copying Books

## 题意翻译

【题目描述】 有m本书（每一本书都有一定的页数）和k台誊抄机器。一台机器只能够誊抄连续的若干本书，每本书只能由一台机器誊抄，每一台机器都必须有誊抄任务，誊抄机器可以同时工作。要求给出满足上述条件的工作分配方式，使得誊抄工作最早完成（即誊抄页数最多的机器誊抄页数最少）。 【输入格式】 第一行有一个正整数N，表示数据组数。 接下来有N组数据，第一行为两个整数m和k，接下来一行有m个整数p1~pm，第i个表示第i本书的页数。 【输出格式】 对于每组数据，输出工作分配方式，如果有多种工作分配方式，则输出机器誊抄页数字典序最靠前的那一种（这种分配方式要让誊抄靠前书本的机器分配到的页数尽量少）。 【数据范围】 N大约为200；1<=k<=m<=500；pi<=10,000,000。

## 题目描述

Before the invention of book-printing, it was very hard to make a copy of a book. All the contents had to be re-written by hand by so called _scribers_. The scriber had been given a book and after several months he finished its copy. One of the most famous scribers lived in the 15th century and his name was Xaverius Endricus Remius Ontius Xendrianus (_Xerox_). Anyway, the work was very annoying and boring. And the only way to speed it up was to hire more scribers.

Once upon a time, there was a theater ensemble that wanted to play famous Antique Tragedies. The scripts of these plays were divided into many books and actors needed more copies of them, of course. So they hired many scribers to make copies of these books. Imagine you have m books (numbered 1, 2 ... m) that may have different number of pages (p $ _{1} $ , p $ _{2} $ ... p $ _{m} $ ) and you want to make one copy of each of them. Your task is to divide these books among k scribes, k <= m. Each book can be assigned to a single scriber only, and every scriber must get a continuous sequence of books. That means, there exists an increasing succession of numbers 0 = b $ _{0} $ < b $ _{1} $ < b $ _{2} $ , ... < b $ _{k-1} $ <= b $ _{k} $ = m such that i-th scriber gets a sequence of books with numbers between b $ _{i-1} $ +1 and b $ _{i} $ . The time needed to make a copy of all the books is determined by the scriber who was assigned the most work. Therefore, our goal is to minimize the maximum number of pages assigned to a single scriber. Your task is to find the optimal assignment.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input consists of N cases (equal to about 200). The first line of the input contains only positive integer N. Then follow the cases. Each case consists of exactly two lines. At the first line, there are two integers m and k, 1 <= k <= m <= 500. At the second line, there are integers p $ _{1} $ , p $ _{2} $ , ... p $ _{m} $ separated by spaces. All these values are positive and less than 10000000.

### 输出格式

For each case, print exactly one line. The line must contain the input succession p $ _{1} $ , p $ _{2} $ , ... p $ _{m} $ divided into exactly k parts such that the maximum sum of a single part should be as small as possible. Use the slash character ('/') to separate the parts. There must be exactly one space character between any two successive numbers and between the number and the slash.

If there is more than one solution, print the one that minimizes the work assigned to the first scriber, then to the second scriber etc. But each scriber must be assigned at least one book.
