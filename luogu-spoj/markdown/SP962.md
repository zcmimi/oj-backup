# IM - Intergalactic Map

## 题目描述

 ![Map](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP962/312963ea8f86282a14989e18d10434bad86e3437.png) Jedi knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his young apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi, are entrusted by Queen Padmé Amidala to save **Naboo** from an invasion by the Trade Federation. They must leave Naboo immediately and go to **Tatooine** to pick up the proof of the Federation’s evil design. They then must proceed on to the Republic’s capital planet **Coruscant** to produce it in front of the Republic’s Senate. To help them in this endeavor, the queen’s captain provides them with an intergalactic map. This map shows connections between planets not yet blockaded by the Trade Federation. Any pair of planets has at most one connection between them, and all the connections are two-way. To avoid detection by enemy spies, the knights must embark on this adventure without visiting any planet more than once. Can you help them by determining if such a path exists?

**Note** - In the attached map, the desired path is shown in bold.
