# MONODIG - Monodigital Representations

## 题目描述

 Let _K_ be a decimal digit different from . We say that an arithmetic expression is a **K-representation of the integer X** if a value of this expression is X and if it contains only numbers composed of a digit K. (All the numbers are of course decimal). The following arithmetical operations are allowed in the expression: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Round brackets are allowed too. Division may appear only when a dividend is a multiple of a divisor.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The number of test cases t is in the first line of input, then t test cases follow separated by an empty line. The first line of each test case contains digit _K_, _K_ is en element of {_1,...,9_}. The second line contains number n, _1<=n<=10_. In the following _n_ lines there is the series of natural numbers _a $ _{1} $ ,...,a $ _{n} $_ , _1<=a $ _{i} $ <=32000_ (for _i=1,..,n_), one number in each line.

### 输出格式

 The output for each test case composes of _n_ lines. The _i-_th line should contain:

- exactly one number which is the minimal length of _K_-representation of a $ _{i} $ , assuming that such a representation of length not grater then 8 exists,

- one word NO, if the minimal length of the _K_-representation of the number _a_ $ _{i} $ is grater than 8.

The first line of each test case contains digit K,  K is en element of
{1,...,9}. The second line
contains number n,  1&amp;lt;=n&amp;lt;=10. In the following  n lines there is the series  of natural numbers
 a1,...,an,  
1&amp;lt;=ai&amp;lt;=32000 (for i=1,..,n), one number in each line.
