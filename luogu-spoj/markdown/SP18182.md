 Mr. Naughty likes to play with balls. So his friend, Mr Nice, gave him **n** balls to play a game. Each ball has exactly two numbers (the number on the top and the number on the bottom). In one move Mr Naughty can rotate any ball so that its bottom now becomes the top. Mr Nice knows the minimum number of such moves that can make at least half of the balls show same number on their top. So to win Mr Nice's game, Mr Naughty should figure out the minimum number of moves. Its not always possible to make such moves that satisfy the given condition.In this case Mr Naughty should figure out that it is **"Impossible"** to make such moves.
