# ADVNTURE - Adventure

## 题目描述

Rand has been sitting in a spaceship at the point (0,0,0) for a long time. One day, he got bored and decided to undertake an adventure.

Deciding upon an adventure has several complicated steps. First, Rand chooses a destination point (x,y,z) different from (0,0,0) such that 0<=x<=A, 0<=y<=B, 0<=z(1,2,3), while if (x,y,z)=(3,0,3) then there are 3 phases (0,0,0)->(1,0,1)->(2,0,2)->(3,0,3) ).

In each phase Rand chooses one of K different activities that he can undertake to pass the time. You need to calculate the total number of different adventures possible, modulo 1000000007 (1e9+7). Two adventures are considered different if they have different destination points, or if the activity undertaken during any of the corresponding phases is different.
