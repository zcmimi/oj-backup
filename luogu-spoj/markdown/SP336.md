# EOPERA - Exchange Operations

## 题目描述

Given a sequence of 12 numbers consisting of 0 and the first 11 natural numbers. Suppose number 0 is in the i-th position of the sequence (positions are numbered from 0 to 11). You can swap it with the number in the j-th position if the following conditions hold:

- | i – j | = d $ _{k} $ , where k=1..3 and (d $ _{1} $ ,d $ _{2} $ ,d $ _{3} $ ,d $ _{4} $ )=(1;3;6;12)

- floor(i/d $ _{k+1} $ )=floor(j/d $ _{k+1} $ )

Your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations required to sort the sequence in increasing order.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input file contains an integer representing the number of test cases to follow. Each test case contains a sequence of twelve numbers consisting of 0,1,2,..,11, separated by single space. You can assume that the given sequence can always be sorted in increasing order by using the exchange operations

### 输出格式

For each test case, output the minimum number of exchange operations required to sort the given sequence in increasing order.
