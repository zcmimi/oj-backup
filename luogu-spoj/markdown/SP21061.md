# YASSP - Yet Another Subset Sum Problem

## 题目描述

Let **Y** be an array of integers of size **N**.

Let **G(x)** be a set comprising of the size of all the subsets of the array Y whose sum is **x**.

Let **F(G(x))** denote the number of unique elements in the set **G(x)**.

Your task is to find the _maximum value of F(G(x))_ and the _corresponding value x_ for the given array Y.

In Case, many 'x' correspond to maximum F(G(x)), _print the smallest one_.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line describes the number of test cases T.

The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly two lines.

The first line contains an integer N indicating the number of elements in the array.

The second line contains N integers separated by single spaces, representing the elements of the array.

### 输出格式

For every test case, print two integers: maximum F(G(x)) and the minimum value of x corresponding to it.

**Constraints**

T<=50

1<=N<=50

1<=Y\[i\]<=1000
