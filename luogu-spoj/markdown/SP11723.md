# COMPLEX2 - HELP ABHISHEK(version-II)

## 题目描述

 ABHISHEK is weak of mathematics he is not able to solve the sequences frequently.

So he invited topcoders to develop a program for solving the sequence. He managed to solve the other kind of sequences except one kind.

The sequence description is as follows:

(x-w)(x-w^2)(x-w^3)(x-w^4).............(x-w^n-1)

here x is a number and w is nth root of unity.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

first line contain number of test cases t. Then t line follow x and n. x and n seprated by a space.

**Constraints:**

2<=x<=1000

2<=n<=1000

t<=410

### 输出格式

print result per case according to above sequence and also keep in mind if there is any term in decimal then write it in form of num/deno. see the I/O for further detail
