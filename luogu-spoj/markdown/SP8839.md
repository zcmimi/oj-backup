# LCDS - Longest Common Difference Subsequence

## 题目描述

GIven two sequences of integers, your task is to find the longest common subsequence where every two adjacent values differ the same.

For example, if the sequences are A = {1, 5, 8, 3} and B = {3, 10, 5}, then the common subsequence with adjacent values same are A $ _{L} $ = {1, 8, 3} and B $ _{L} $ = {3, 10, 5} since the differences in A $ _{L} $ are 7 and -5 which is also the same in B $ _{L} $ .

### Input

First line of the input contains N $ _{A} $ and N $ _{B} $ , the sizes of the sequences A and B. Then follow two lines, the sequences A and B. (1 <= N $ _{A} $ , N $ _{B} $ <= 1000 and all values in the sequence will lie between -1e9 and 1e9).

### Output

Print one line, the length of the LCDS as described above.
