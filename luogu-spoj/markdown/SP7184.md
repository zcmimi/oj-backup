# AXIS - Axis of Symmetry

## 题目描述

Given a point p and a line L on the plane, the reflection of p against L is a point q such that

the segment pq is perpendicular to L and its middle point is on L. If p is on L, then p = q.

Given a set of points on the plane, an axis of symmetry is a line on the plane such that the

reflection of any point of the set against that line gives a point of the set.

In this problem you are given a set of points on the plane, and you must decide whether there

exists at least one axis of symmetry or not.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains several test cases, each one described in several lines. The first line of each

test case contains an integer N indicating the number of points in the set (3 Each of the next N lines describes a different point of the set using two integers X and Y

separated by a single space (−2000 of the point in the XY plane. You may assume that no two points of each test case have the

same location. The last line of the input contains a single −1 and should not be processed as

a test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case output a single line with an uppercase “Y” if there exists at least one axis of

symmetry for the provided set of points, or an uppercase “N” otherwise.
