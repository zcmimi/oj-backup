# DOJO - With a Pit of Death

## 题目描述

Leo is training his martial arts in byteland's dojo.

The dojo is a rectangular ( n × m ) area with a pit of death, a square located at (i, j), where 1 <= i <= n, and 1 <= j <= m.

Every night, battles are very hard and the dojo is destructed, and reconstructed during the day around the pit.

Every evening, Leo's first mission is to make in place tatamis ( 2 × 1 ) in the new dojo.

Tatamis should cover the whole dojo except the pit of death.

Sometimes it's possible, sometimes not!
