# NINJA1 - Related or not

## 题目描述

Problem statement:

You are given two DNA sequences A and B. It is said that these two DNA sequences are related if there exists a non-decreasing sequence C of the same length, such that C $ _{i} $ **=** A $ _{i} $ or C $ _{i} $ = B $ _{i} $ . Find if the given sequences are related.

Input format:

The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases.

 For each test case:

The first line contains an integer,N, the length of the DNA sequence.

The second line contains a sequence of space-separated integers describing species A.

The third line contains a sequence of space-separated integers describing species B.

**Output Format**

On a new line for each test case, print **YES** if a non-decreasing sequence of the same length can be found or **NO** if it cannot.

Constraints:

 1

1 <= N 

0 i, Bi 10 ^ 10

Sample input:

```

```

`3` `3` `1 2 3` `4 4 4` `3` `3 2 1` `6 5 4` `2` `1 0` `10 2` ```

```

`Sample Output:` `YES` `NO` `YES`
