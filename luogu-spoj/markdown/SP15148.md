# POP2 - play with prime numbers (II)

## 题目描述

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Example:** 1013 consists of 101 and 3 and both are prime.

**Notes**: 2003 is not POP because leading zeros are not allowed.

The POP numbers must contain more than or equal two primes, and overlapping is not allowed .
