# DEPEND - Dependency Problems

## 题目描述

We bought a brand new computer and now we would like to install an operating system. The only problem is that our chosen operating system consists of many packages and they cannot be installed in an arbitrary order. E.g. you cannot install the package tuxracer, which depends on the package libSDL, before you install libSDL. But libSDL can depend on another packages and so on. The packages may only be installed one at a time. You may install a package only if you already installed all packages it depends on. Your task is to determine how many packages can be installed on our computer.
