## 题目描述

There are ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP17877/169265ff2535c9e3f13c7674d3e988cc0267cb40.png) old trees planted along a road that goes from the top of a hill to its bottom. Local government decided to cut them down. In order not to waste wood each tree should be transported to a sawmill.

Trees can be transported only in one direction: downwards. There is a sawmill at the lower end of the road. Two additional sawmills can be built along the road. You have to decide where to build them, as to minimize the cost of transportation. The transportation costs one cent per meter, per kilogram of wood.
