# GSWORDS - Counting Words

## 题目描述

_Supervin likes counting. In this problem, he invites you to count together_

Supervin defines a **word** as "a string only consist of 'o' or 'x'", and additional requirement, for each substring with prime-length, the number of 'o' is not less than the number of 'x'.

Supervin gives you an integer **N** (1 <= **N** <= 10^12). Supervin challenges you to determine how many **words** can be made with exactly **N**-length.

You are having difficulties, make a program to determine how many **N**-length **words**. Because the output can be too big, output the number of **words** modulo 1 000 000 007
