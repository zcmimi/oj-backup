# MYQ8 - The National Game

## 题目描述

Prasanna and Nithin had mastered Thuvax's national game, [TicTacToe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

TicTacToe is a board game for two players, x and o, who take turns (alternatively) marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid with their signs 'x' and 'o' respectively. The x player goes first. The player who succeeds in placing three of his signs in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game and the game stops there.

While returning from a TicTacToe tournament, Prasanna and Nithin find a tictactoe like grid. They decide to continue playing from the state the board was in. Help Nithin find whether the next person to move will win/lose or whether the game will result in a tie (assuming both players play optimally), or if such a state is invalid.

```


### 输出样例 #1

```cpp
lose \ntie \ninvalid\n\nExplanation: \nCase 1: Player x can win by placing x in either last cell of the middle row, or the first cell of the last row. So the next player, o, cant prevent him from winning from this state. \nCase 2: It is completed game, as you can see no one has won. So, it has ended in a tie. \nCase 3: Player x should have started the game. Hence such a state can never be reached.
