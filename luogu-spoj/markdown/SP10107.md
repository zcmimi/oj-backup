# DONUT - Cybercrime Donut Investigation

## 题目描述

Year 2042. The Internet has evolved to a virtual reality dataspace where crimes are committed every day. The 2041 SWERC winner developed an agent that drops a donut every time a crime is committed in the Cyberspace. Each of the donuts has its own signature. The Madrid Police have a huge database with crimes and their donut signatures.

Today is your day. Your task is to implement a new agent that looks for the records in the database that bear a strong resemblance to the given signature of a dropped donut found at a new crime scene.
