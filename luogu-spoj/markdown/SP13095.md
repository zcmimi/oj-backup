## 题目描述

You are given a sequence of numbers s, you are required to find 3 indices i, j, k, where i < j < k and (s\[i\] = s\[k\] or s\[i\] >= s\[j\] <= s\[k\]) if there are many solutions you should find the one where |s\[i\]-s\[j\]| + |s\[j\]-s\[k\]| is maximized, if there are still many solutions you should find the one which comes earlier in order (i.e. i1, j1, k1, comes before i2, j2, k2, if i1<i2, or if i1=i2, and j1<j2, or if i1=i2, j1=j2, and k1<k2 ).
