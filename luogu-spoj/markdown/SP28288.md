# BLAMOEBA - Super Amoeba

## 题目描述

Peter has an amoeba farm with pretty much unlimited amoebae. After years of research, Peter created a device to convert some amoebae to super amoebae. However, his device can only be used once. Every day, a super amoeba will split into M super amoebae (2 < M < 100000).

Now, Peter plan his amoeba selling business. Initially, Peter converts X amoebae to super amoebae (X > 1). Every day after the amoebae split, Peter will take Y super amoebae for sale (Y > 1). After N days, Peter want all of his amoebae to be completely sold out (1 < N < 100000). Since the energy needed to convert amoebae is quite massive, X must be as small as possible. Help peter plan his business!
