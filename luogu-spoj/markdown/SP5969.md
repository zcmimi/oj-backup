# FINDMAX - Finding Maximum

## 题目描述

 One way of finding the maximum element in an array is to initialize a variable to the first element in the array, iterate through the remaining array, and update the variable whenever a value strictly greater than it is found. Assuming that the array contains N elements each in the range 1..K, how many such arrays exist such that the above algorithm performs exactly P updates? Initialization of the variable is not counted as an update.

For example,the possible arrays for N = 4, K = 3 and P = 2 are:

1) {1,1,2,3}

2\) {1,2,1,3}

3\) {1,2,2,3}

4\) {1,2,3,1}

5\) {1,2,3,2}

6\) {1,2,3,3}

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line contains T the number of test cases. There follow T lines, containing 3 space seperated integers N, K and P.

### 输出格式

 Output T lines, one for each test case. On each line, output the answer as asked above. Since the answers can get very big, output the answer modulo 1000000007.
