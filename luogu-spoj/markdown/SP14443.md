Now, your task is to compute radius of small circle that can be created like yellow circle in the picture above. All circles in the picture above tangent each other.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line in the input data, there is an integer **T**(0 < **T** T lines follow.

For each lines, there are three integer **R1**, **R2**, and **R3**, (0 < {**R1**,**R2**,**R3**} < 10 $ ^{30} $ ) denoting radius of each circle like in the picture above.

### 输出格式

For each test case, output radius of small circle that can be made, like in the picture above. Truncate the output to 50 digit after decimal point.
