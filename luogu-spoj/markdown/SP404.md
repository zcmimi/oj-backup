# SCANNER - Scanner

## 题目描述

 A body scanner works by scanning a succession of horizontal slices through the body; the slices are imaged one at a time. The image slices can be reassembled to form a three dimensional model of the object. Write a program to construct a two dimensional image slice using data captured during the scan.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input file begins with a line with an integer indicating the number of image slices to follow. For each image slice, there are separate lines with 10, 24, 15, and 24 integers representing sensor data from sensor arrays 1 through 4 respectively. The order of the readings is indicated in the diagram. You can assume that there exist at least one image for the given sensor data.

### 输出格式

 For each slice, your program should print 10 lines of 15 cells. To indicate that the cell represents a part of the object, print a hash character (\#) for the cell; to indicate that the cell is not a part of the object, print a period (.). Between successive output image slices, print a blank line.

It is possible for the result of a scan to be ambiguous, in that case you can print any solution.
