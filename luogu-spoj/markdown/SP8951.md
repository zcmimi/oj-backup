# XIXO - brownie

## 题目描述

```

Bessie has baked a rectangular brownie that can be thought of as

an RxC grid (1 <= R <= 500; 1 <= C 

The square at row i, column j contains N_ij (0 <= N_ij 

chocolate chips.

Bessie wants to partition the brownie up into A*B chunks (1 

<= R; 1 <= B 

cut by first making A-1 horizontal cuts (always along integer

coordinates) to divide the brownie into A strips. Then cut each

strip *independently* with B-1 vertical cuts, also on integer

boundaries. The other A*B-1 cows then each choose a brownie piece,

leaving the last chunk for Bessie. Being greedy, they leave Bessie

the brownie that has the least number of chocolate chips on it.

Determine the maximum number of chocolate chips Bessie can receive,

assuming she cuts the brownies optimally.

As an example, consider a 5 row x 4 column brownie with chips

distributed like this:

1 2 2 1

3 1 1 1

2 0 1 3

1 1 1 1

1 1 1 1

Bessie must partition the brownie into 4 horizontal strips, each

with two pieces. Bessie can cut the brownie like this:

1 2 | 2 1

---------

3 | 1 1 1

---------

2 0 1 | 3

---------

1 1 | 1 1

1 1 | 1 1

Thus, when the other greedy cows take their brownie piece, Bessie

still gets 3 chocolate chips.
