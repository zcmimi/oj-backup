# GRIDPNTS - Grid points (speed variation)

## 题目描述

There's a Cartesian lattice with 0<=x,y0) in this lattice rotating clockwise as little as possible around the origin find the next point (x2, y2). The given and searched points mustn't have another point between the origin (0, 0) and this point itself.

x1, y1, x2, y2 are non-negative integers.
