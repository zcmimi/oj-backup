# WPC5G - The dilemma of Idli

## 题目描述

It is emergency time! There has been a clash between the organizers of the Galactical Wars and the Inter-Galactic Parliament due to some feud. The entire civilization has been split into two groups A and B. The civilians in A love some particular members in the Organization Committee of the Galactical Wars, and hate some members from the Inter-Galactic Parliament. On the other hand, civilians in B love some particular members from the Inter-Galactic Parliament, and hate some in the Organization Committee.

You are Idli, the Inter-Galactic Dean, and it is your job to ensure satisfaction of the civilians. You decide to do so by impeaching some members from the Organization Committee and some from the Parliament. A civilian is satisfied if and only if all the members he loves are not impeached, and all the members he hates are impeached.

Of course, Idli wants to satisfy most number of civilians. Help Idli in devising an algorithm to do so.
