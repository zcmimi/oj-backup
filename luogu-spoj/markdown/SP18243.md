# IITWPC4A - Maggu and Strings

## 题目描述

Maggu and Coder were playing a game with strings. In each turn of the game, Maggu gives Coder a string. Coder can replace m consecutive 'a' in the string by n consecutive 'b' any number of times. This way he has to create 2 strings, one of maximum possible length and one of minimum possible length.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input contains a single integer T : number of test cases.(1<=T<=100).

For each test case there are exactly two lines.

First line contains a string s (1 <= length(s) <= 10^5) containing letters only from 'a' to 'z'.

Second line contains two space separated integers representing m and n respectively.(1 <= m,n <= 10^5).

Sum of length(s) over all test cases is <= 10^6.

### 输出格式

For each test case, print in a single line containing two space separated integers representing minimum and maximum length of string s that Coder can obtain.
