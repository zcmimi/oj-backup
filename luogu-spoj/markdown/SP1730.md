# TCOUNT2 - Counting Triangles II

## 题目描述

We define the LEVEL of a triangle as in the following illustrative image:

And we continue defining the LEVEL of a hexagon. It's called level N hexagon if it’s joined by 6 triangles, each one is a level N triangle.

**Task:** All you have to do is to count all triangles in the “level N” hexagon.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases and T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N which is the level of the hexagon in that test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case, you should write a seperate line: the number of triangles in the “level N” hexagon. (All answers will fit within the range of a 64-bit positive integer)
