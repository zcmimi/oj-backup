# GAME3 - Yet Another Fancy Game

## 题目描述

Two girls - Ivica and Marica - play an interesting game.

First, they randomly choose a natural number N. They also define M = 1.

Ivica plays first, then Marica, then Ivica, then Marica and so on.

In each move, a girl has to increase M by 1 or multiply M by 2 (that is, M = M+1 or M = 2\*M). The resulting number **must not be greater than N**.

The **loser** of the game is the girl who gets M = N. The other girl is, of course, the winner.

Write a program to determine the winner, assuming that both girls play optimally.
