# SAMTWARR - Two Array Problem

## 题目描述

You are given two arrays each of length N(1 <= N <= 100000) which are initially filled with zeros. You have to apply M (1 <= M <= 100000) queries of three kind:

**0 arr left right :** calculate and output sum of elements from left to right in array arr (arr = 0 -- first array, arr = 1 -- second array);

**1 arr idx newValue :** change value of element at index idx of array arr on newValue;

**2 left right :** swap range of elements of two arrays from left to right ( for i = left to right do swap(a\[i\], b\[i\]) );

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers - N, M. The folowing M lines contains information about queries.

On each query - one line:

First integer number cmd contains 0, 1 or 2 (type of query described above).

if cmd equals 0, then following 3 integers arr, left, right - 0 <= arr <= 1, 0 <= left <= right <= N - 1.

if cmd equals **1**, then following 3 integers arr, idx, newValue - 0 <= arr <= 1, 0 <= idx <= N - 1, -10000 <= newValue <= 10000.

if cmd equals **2**, then following 2 integers left, right - 0 <= left <= right <= N - 1.

### 输出格式

On each query with cmd equals 0 you should output corresponding value described above.
