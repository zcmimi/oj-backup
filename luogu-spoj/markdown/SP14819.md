# PERMTGEN - Permutation Generator

## 题目描述

Hasan Jaddouh has invented a new algorithm for generating permutations this algorithm takes an array with length N as input and generate a permutation with length N from this array.

the array must satsify (1 <= Ai <= i) in order for the resulting array to be a permutation.

and here is the pseudo code of the algorithm:

```

read N

for i=1 to N do

read A[i]

for i=1 to N do

for j=1 to i-1 do

if A[j] >= A[i] do

A[j]=A[j]+1

for i=1 to N do

print A[i]

```

but unfortunately for Hasan Jaddouh, his algorithm is too slow for big arrays so he asked you to help him to find a fast way to implement his algorithm.

your program should read input same as the pseudo code and output the new array

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

first line contains integer N (1 <= N <= 10 $ ^{5} $ )

second line contains N integers separated by spaces each interger is between 1 and 10 $ ^{9} $ inclusive

**note:** in order for Hasan Jaddouh's algorithm to work and generate a permutation the constrain (1 <= Ai <= i) must be satsified but to make this problem harder this constrian is **not** guaranteed so it's also not necessary that the output is a permutation.

### 输出格式

Output N integers separated by spaces, the new array after applying Hasan Jaddouh's algorithm
