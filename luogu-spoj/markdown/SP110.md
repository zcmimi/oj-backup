# CISTFILL - Fill the Cisterns

## 题意翻译

有n个底部互相连通的长方体水箱，给出每个水箱的位置和长宽高，求出倒入v体积的水时水面的高度，精确到两位小数

输入：

第一行：一个正整数k，表示数据组数（1<=k<=30）

对之后的每组数据：

第一行为一个整数n，表示水箱个数；(1<=n<=5000)

接下来的n行每行有四个整数b,h,w,d,分别表示水箱的底面高度，它的高、长、宽；（0<=b<=10^6,1<=h*w*d<=40000）

最后一行为一个整数v，表示加入的水的体积（1<=v<=2*10^9）

输出

对每组数据，如果能装下，则输出此时水面高度；如果不能，则输出OVERFLOW

## 题目描述

 During the next century certain regions on earth will experience severe water shortages. The old town of Uqbar has already started to prepare itself for the worst. Recently they created a network of pipes connecting the cisterns that distribute water in each neighbourhood, making it easier to fill them at once from a single source of water. But in case of water shortage the cisterns above a certain level will be empty since the water will flow to the cisterns below.

![Example of cistern arrangement](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/SP110/cfc67279f531e1e6bfd4be8b44ac35bd2f428f57.png) You have been asked to write a program to compute the level to which cisterns will be filled with a certain volume of water, given the dimensions and position of each cistern. To simplify we will neglect the volume of water in the pipes.

### Task

Write a program that:

- reads the description of cisterns and the volume of water,

- computes the level to which the cisterns will be filled with the given amount of water,

- writes the result.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of the input contains the number of data sets k, 1 <= k <= 30. The data sets follow.

The first line of each data set contains one integer n, the number of cisterns, 1 <= n <= 50000. Each of the following n lines consists of 4 nonnegative integers, separated by single spaces: b, h, w, d - the base level of the cistern, its height, width and depth in meters, respectively. The integers satisfy 0 <= b <= 10 $ ^{6} $ and 1 <= h\*w\*d <= 40000. The last line of the data set contains an integer V - the volume of water in cubic meters to be injected into the network. Integer V satisfies 1 <= V <= 2\*10 $ ^{9} $ .

### 输出格式

 The output should consist of exactly d lines, one line for each data set. Line i, 1 <= i <= d, should contain the level that the water will reach, in meters, rounded to two fractional digits, or the word "OVERFLOW" (without quotes), if the volume of water exceeds the total capacity of the cisterns.
