# HPPROF - Help Professor

## 题目描述

One day, TA of one of the course at DA-IICT was checking First In-sem exam papers. The exam was of 20 marks. After checking some of the papers, he decided to give marks of those students to his professor but he messed up here. He forgot to put spaces between the marks. So professor got confused.

Since you are his favourite student, help him determine the number of ways in which this marks can be seperated (by spaces) so that they are valid marks.

Marks are valid if they are between 0 to 20 and have no leading zeros. For example, 0, 1, 2, 3 ... 20 are valid but 01, 003, 21, 25 are not valid.

**Input**
