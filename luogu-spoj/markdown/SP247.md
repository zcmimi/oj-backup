# CHOCOLA - Chocolate

## 题目描述

 We are given a bar of chocolate composed of _m\*n_ square pieces. One should break the chocolate into single squares. Parts of the chocolate may be broken along the vertical and horizontal lines as indicated by the broken lines in the picture.

A single break of a part of the chocolate along a chosen vertical or horizontal line divides that part into two smaller ones. Each break of a part of the chocolate is charged a cost expressed by a positive integer. This cost does not depend on the size of the part that is being broken but only depends on the line the break goes along. Let us denote the costs of breaking along consecutive vertical lines with _x_ $ _{1} $ , _x_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _x_ $ _{m-1} $ and along horizontal lines with _y_ $ _{1} $ , _y_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _y_ $ _{n-1} $ .

The cost of breaking the whole bar into single squares is the sum of the successive breaks. One should compute the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares.

### Task

Write a program that for each test case:

- Reads the numbers _x_ $ _{1} $ , _x_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _x_ $ _{m-1} $ and _y_ $ _{1} $ , _y_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _y_ $ _{n-1} $

- Computes the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares, writes the result.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 One integer in the first line, stating the number of test cases, followed by a blank line. There will be not more than 20 tests.

For each test case, at the first line there are two positive integers _m_ and _n_ separated by a single space, 2 <= _m_,_n_ <= 1000. In the successive _m_-1 lines there are numbers _x_ $ _{1} $ , _x_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _x_ $ _{m-1} $ , one per line, 1 <= _x_ $ _{i} $ <= 1000. In the successive _n_-1 lines there are numbers _y_ $ _{1} $ , _y_ $ _{2} $ , ..., _y_ $ _{n-1} $ , one per line, 1 <= _y_ $ _{i} $ <= 1000.

The test cases will be separated by a single blank line.

### 输出格式

 For each test case : write one integer - the minimal cost of breaking the whole chocolate into single squares.
