# ASSIGN4 - Another Assignment Problem

## 题目描述

 Assume that you are a manager and there are m types of worker (numbered from 1 to m) and n types of task (numbered from 1 to n). There are a(i) workers of type #i and b(j) postitions for task #j. C(i, j) is the cost of hiring a worker of type #i to do the task of type #j. Your job is to minimize the cost of hiring workers to fill all the positions given that the total number of workers is equal to the total number of positions.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 The first line of input contains the number of test cases nTest (1<= nTest <= 10). Each test case contains:

- The first line contains the number of worker types - m and number of task types - n.

- The second line contains m positive integers: a(1), a(2), ..., a(m).

- The third line contains n positive integers: b(1), b(2), ..., b(n).

- Each of the next m lines contains n integers describing matrix C(i, j).

Notes:

1 <= m, n <= 200;

1 <= a(i), b(i) <= 30000;

1 <= C(i, j) <= 10000.

Sum of a(i) equals to sum of b(j).

### 输出格式

 For each test case write the minimum cost in a separate line (it will fit in a signed 32-bit integer).
