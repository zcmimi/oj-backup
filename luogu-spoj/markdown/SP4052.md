Hal and Dave are playing an interesting game on a rectangular

chess like board consisting of squares arranged in R rows and C columns.

Here are the rules of the game:

• There is only one piece on a board alternately moved by the

players.

• One move of the piece consists of moving it to an adjacent square

in one of following directions: down, right or diagonally right–down.

• Some squares on a board are ‘forbidden’, i.e. the piece cannot

enter such squares.

• A square may contain at most one of the following: a

hamburger, french fries, ice cream. A player who moves the piece to

a square with a hamburger receives 1 point, with french fries 3 points

and with ice cream 5 points.

• The game ends when a player who should make a move cannot

make it (because piece would fall off of board or enter a forbidden

square in all three directions).

• If at the end of a game both players have same number of

points, then the one who cannot make a legal move lost that game.

• If at the end of a game players have different numbers of

points, then the player with more points won the game.

• Both players have 0 points at the beginning of a game. Hal

makes first move. The initial position of the piece is a square that

is not forbidden and it does not contain any food.

Since there is a finite number of sequence of moves finishing any

given game, it can be proved that for any given initial position of

the piece either Dave or Hal can win no matter how the other player

plays, i.e. he has a winning strategy.

A board, positions of forbidden squares, positions of squares with

food and some initial positions are given. Write a program that

will determine for each given initial position which player has a

winning strategy.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

```

The first line of input file contains two integers R, number of rows

(2 ≤ R ≤ 100) and C, number of columns (2 ≤ C ≤ 100) of a board,

separated by a space character.

Each of next R lines contains a sequence of C characters representing

a corresponding row of the board. Forbidden squares are represented

with ‘#’ character. Squares containing food are represented

with letters H (hamburger), F (french fries) and I (ice cream). Other

squares are represented with a dot character (‘.’).

The next line

contains an integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 100, the number of given initial positions

for which a program should find which player has a winning strategy.

Each of the following N lines contain two integers A (1 ≤ A ≤ R) and

B (1 ≤ B ≤ C), separated with a space character, which determine a

row and a column of an initial position of a piece.

Rows are numbered from up to down with number from 1 to R, and

columns are numbered from left to right with numbers from 1 to C.

```

### 输出格式

```

Output file should contain N lines. The ith line should contain name

of a player (i.e. DAVE or HAL) having a winning strategy for ith given

initial position.
