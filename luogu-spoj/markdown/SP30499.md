# HARSTR - TWO STRINGS

## 题目描述

You are given two strings _a_ and _b_. You have to remove the minimum possible number of consecutive (standing one after another) characters from string _b_ in such a way that it becomes a[submultiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset)of string _a_. It can happen that you will not need to remove any characters at all, or maybe you will have to remove all of the characters from _b_ and make it empty.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains string _a_, and the second line — string _b_. Both of these strings are nonempty and consist of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The length of each string is no bigger than 105 characters.

### 输出格式

On the first line output a submultiset of string _a_ in **sorted** order , obtained from _b_. If multiple answer exists , output [lexicographically smallest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order)[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order)

If the answer consists of zero characters, output «-» (a minus sign).
