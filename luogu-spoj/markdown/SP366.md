# FARMER - Farmer

## 题意翻译

题目描述

农场主hzy拥有很多ym，它们在田野里吃草，快乐地四处走动。现在hzy 有G个金币，他可以用这些金币够买化肥，也能用来购置饲料。hzy拥有n头牛崽和m块种有特定作物的农田。hzy将一头牛崽养大或让一块农田的作物成熟都要花费一定数量的金币来购买饲料或化肥，每当他收获一头牛或一块作物田，他就能收获一点happy值。想要收获不同的作物和cows所需花费的金币数也不同。由于hzy不喜欢吃肉，所以他就将牛肉和精灵交换，作为交换条件，精灵会使用魔法来帮助hzy立刻收获一定数量的牛或作物（当然可以一部分是牛崽，另一部分是作物。如：精灵可以帮助hzy收获4个数量的牛或作物，那么，hzy可以选择让1头牛和3个作物收获，或2个牛和2个作物能收获，也可以让4个牛能收获，更或者让4个作物能收获。此外数据保证hzy至少能收获一个）。现在hzy想要知道自己最多能获得多少点happy值，同时花费的金币数量最少。

输入

输入数据的第一行是一个数据T，表示有T组数据。每组测试数据的第一行是三个数G, n, m（1<=G<=10,000 0<=n<=100 0<=m<=100 1<=n + m<=200) 分别表示hzy所拥有的金币数，牛崽的个数和种有作物的农田数，接下来n行，每一行有两个数ai, bi(1<=ai<=10,000 1<=bi<=1,000)分别表示第i头牛崽需要花费ai的金币才能养大，与精灵交换能获得bi数量的牛崽或作物能被收获。接下来m行，每一行有一个数ci，表示让第i个作物种熟需要花费ci个金币。

输出

对于每组输入数据，先输出单独一行"Case #i:"（其中i表示第i组测试数据，从1开始）接下来输出一行。两个数分别表示剩余的happy值和金币数。

## 题目描述

 A farmer has a set of fields, each of which is surrounded by cypress trees. Also, the farmer has a set of strips of land, each of which has a row of cypress trees. In both fields and strips, between every two consecutive cypress trees is a single olive tree. All of the farmer’s cypress trees either surround a field or are in a strip and all of the farmer’s olive trees are between two consecutive cypress trees in a field or in a strip.

One day the farmer became very ill and he felt that he was going to die. A few days before he passed away he called his eldest son and told him, “I give you any Q cypress trees of your choice and all the olive trees which are between any two consecutive cypress trees you have chosen.” >From each field and from each strip the son can pick any combination of cypress trees. Since the eldest son loves olives he wants to pick the Q cypress trees which will allow him to inherit as many olive trees as possible.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

 t - the number of test cases \[t <= 20\], then t test cses follows. The first line of each test case contains first the integer Q: the number of cypress trees the son is to select; then the integer M, the number of fields; and then the integer K, the number of strips. The second line contains M integers N1, N2,… NM, : the numbers of cypress trees in fields. The third line contains K integers R1, R2,… RK: the numbers of cypress trees in strips.

In all test cases, 0 <= Q <= 150000, 0 <= M <= 2000, 0 <= K <= 2000, 3 <= N1 <= 150, 3 <= N2 <= 150,… 3 <= NM <=150, 2 <= R1 <= 150, 2 <= R2 <= 150,… 2 <= RK <= 150. The total number of cypress trees in the fields and strips is at least Q. Additionally, in 50% of the test cases, Q <= 1500.

### 输出格式

For each test case output ont integer: largest possible number of olive trees the son may inherit.
