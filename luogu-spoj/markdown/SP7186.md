# COUNTPAS - Counting Pascal

## 题意翻译

给定一些数（以-1结尾），对于每个数k(k不为-1)，输出杨辉三角里所有满足条件$1<x<=k$的$x$的个数 样例： Input ``` 2 6 -1 ``` Output ``` 1 10 ``` (by WarrenWN)

## 题目描述

Pascal’s triangle is a common figure in combinatorics. It is a triangle formed by rows of integers.

The top row contains a single 1. Each new row has one element more than the previous one

and is formed as follows: the leftmost and rightmost values are 1, while each of the other values

is the sum of the two values above it. Here we depict the first 7 rows of the triangle.

1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 1 6 15 20 15 6 1Pascal’s triangle is infinite, of course, and contains the value 1 an unbounded number of times.

However, any other value appears a finite number of times in the triangle. In this problem you

are given an integer K >= 2. Your task is to calculate the number of values in the triangle that

are different from 1 and less than or equal to K.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The input contains several test cases. Each test case is described in a single line that contains

an integer K (2 processed as a test case.

### 输出格式

For each test case output a single line with an integer indicating the number of values in Pascal’s

triangle that are different from 1 and less than or equal to K.
