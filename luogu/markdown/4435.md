## 题意翻译

最近，斯科拉夫一直在研究自然数的序列。如果序列中所有数的最大公约数大于1，他会认为序列很有趣。昨天，他在车库里发现了一个由N个自然数组成的序列。由于他真的很无聊，他决定通过做两种操作使自己有事做 1:将序列中位置X的值更改为V 2：确定序列的区间[L，R]中包含的有趣的连续子阵列的数量

## 题目描述

Lately, Slavko’s been studying sequences of natural numbers. He finds a sequence

interesting if the greatest common divisor of all the elements from the sequence is greater

than 1.

Yesterday, he found a sequence consisting of N natural numbers in his garage. Since he

was really bored, he decided to keep himself occupied by asking simple queries. Each query

can be one of the two types:

1. Change the value at position X in the sequence to V.

2. Determine the number of interesting contiguous subarrays contained in the interval

[L, R] of the sequence.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains the numbers N and Q (1 ≤ N, Q ≤ $10^5$

), representing the

number of elements in the sequence and the number of queries, respectively.

The following line contains N natural numbers $A_i$

(1 ≤ $A_i$ ≤ $10^9$

) that represent the numbers in

the initial sequence.

Each of the following Q lines contains a query of the following form:

- The first number in the line can be 1 or 2 and represents the type of the query.

- If the query is of type 1, two numbers follow, X (1 ≤ X ≤ N) and V (1 ≤ V ≤ $10^9$

) from

the task.

- If the query is of type 2, two numbers follow, L and R (1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N) that represent

the left and right interval boundary.

### 输出格式

For each query of type 2, output the number of interesting contiguous subarrays from the

task.

## 说明

**Clarification​ ​of​ ​the​ ​first​ ​test​ ​case:**

The interval from the $2_{nd}$ to the $5_{th}$ position consists of numbers (4, 3, 9, 1). In it, the following are

interesting contiguous subarrays (denoted with square brackets):

**[4]**​ 3 9 1, 4 **[3]​** ​9 1, 4 3 **[9]**​ 1, 4 **[3​ ​9]​** 1
