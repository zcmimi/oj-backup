# Square Table

## 题目描述

While resting on the ship after the "Russian Code Cup" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size $ n×m $ , consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.

Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed $ 10^{8} $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=100 $ ) — the size of the table.

### 输出格式

Print the table that meets the condition: $ n $ lines containing $ m $ integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.
