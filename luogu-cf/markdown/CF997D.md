# Cycles in product

## 题目描述

Consider a tree (that is, an undirected connected graph without loops) $ T_1 $ and a tree $ T_2 $ . Let's define their cartesian product $ T_1 \times T_2 $ in a following way.

Let $ V $ be the set of vertices in $ T_1 $ and $ U $ be the set of vertices in $ T_2 $ .

Then the set of vertices of graph $ T_1 \times T_2 $ is $ V \times U $ , that is, a set of ordered pairs of vertices, where the first vertex in pair is from $ V $ and the second — from $ U $ .

Let's draw the following edges:

- Between $ (v, u_1) $ and $ (v, u_2) $ there is an undirected edge, if $ u_1 $ and $ u_2 $ are adjacent in $ U $ .

- Similarly, between $ (v_1, u) $ and $ (v_2, u) $ there is an undirected edge, if $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $ are adjacent in $ V $ .

Please see the notes section for the pictures of products of trees in the sample tests.

Let's examine the graph $ T_1 \times T_2 $ . How much cycles (not necessarily simple) of length $ k $ it contains? Since this number can be very large, print it modulo $ 998244353 $ .

The sequence of vertices $ w_1 $ , $ w_2 $ , ..., $ w_k $ , where $ w_i \in V \times U $ called cycle, if any neighboring vertices are adjacent and $ w_1 $ is adjacent to $ w_k $ . Cycles that differ only by the cyclic shift or direction of traversal are still considered different.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

First line of input contains three integers — $ n_1 $ , $ n_2 $ and $ k $ ( $ 2 \le n_1, n_2 \le 4000 $ , $ 2 \le k \le 75 $ ) — number of vertices in the first tree, number of vertices in the second tree and the cycle length respectively.

Then follow $ n_1 - 1 $ lines describing the first tree. Each of this lines contains two integers — $ v_i, u_i $ ( $ 1 \le v_i, u_i \le n_1 $ ), which define edges of the first tree.

Then follow $ n_2 - 1 $ lines, which describe the second tree in the same format.

It is guaranteed, that given graphs are trees.

### 输出格式

Print one integer — number of cycles modulo $ 998244353 $ .

## 说明

The following three pictures illustrate graph, which are products of the trees from sample tests.

In the first example, the list of cycles of length $ 2 $ is as follows:

- «AB», «BA»

- «BC», «CB»

- «AD», «DA»

- «CD», «DC»
