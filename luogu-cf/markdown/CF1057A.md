## 题目描述

Once upon a time there was only one router in the well-known company Bmail. Years went by and over time new routers were purchased. Every time they bought a new router, they connected it to one of the routers bought before it. You are given the values $ p_i $ — the index of the router to which the $ i $ -th router was connected after being purchased ( $ p_i < i $ ).

There are $ n $ routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the $ n $ -th router.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer number $ n $ ( $ 2 \le n \le 200000 $ ) — the number of the routers. The following line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_2, p_3, \dots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \le p_i < i $ ), where $ p_i $ is equal to index of the router to which the $ i $ -th was connected after purchase.

### 输出格式

Print the path from the $ 1 $ -st to the $ n $ -th router. It starts with $ 1 $ and ends with $ n $ . All the elements in the path should be distinct.
