# You Are Given a WASD-string...

## 题目描述

You have a string $ s $ — a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four commands:

- 'W' — move one cell up;

- 'S' — move one cell down;

- 'A' — move one cell left;

- 'D' — move one cell right.

Let $ Grid(s) $ be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands $ s $ . For example, if $ s = \text{DSAWWAW} $ then $ Grid(s) $ is the $ 4 \times 3 $ grid:

1. you can place the robot in the cell $ (3, 2) $ ;

2. the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to $ (3, 3) $ ;

3. the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to $ (4, 3) $ ;

4. the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $ (4, 2) $ ;

5. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $ (3, 2) $ ;

6. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $ (2, 2) $ ;

7. the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to $ (2, 1) $ ;

8. the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to $ (1, 1) $ .

What is the minimum area of $ Grid(s) $ you can achieve?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $ T $ ( $ 1 \le T \le 1000 $ ) — the number of queries.

Next $ T $ lines contain queries: one per line. This line contains single string $ s $ ( $ 1 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ , $ s_i \in \{\text{W}, \text{A}, \text{S}, \text{D}\} $ ) — the sequence of commands.

It's guaranteed that the total length of $ s $ over all queries doesn't exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .

### 输出格式

Print $ T $ integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area of $ Grid(s) $ you can achieve.

## 说明

In the first query you have to get string $ \text{DSAWW}\underline{D}\text{AW} $ .

In second and third queries you can not decrease the area of $ Grid(s) $ .
