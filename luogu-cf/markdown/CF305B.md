# Continued Fractions

## 题意翻译

给定$p,q,a_1,a_2,...,a_n,$若$\frac{p}{q}=a_1+\frac{1}{a_2+\frac{1}{...+\frac{1}{a_n}}}$则输出"YES",否则输出"NO".(不包含引号)

$n<=90,1<=q<=p<=10^{18},1<=a_i<=10^{18}.$

## 题目描述

A continued fraction of height $ n $ is a fraction of form ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF305B/19ade84928d3d628a6e212b03adbbf8bc0856736.png). You are given two rational numbers, one is represented as ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF305B/ae456f9650d5b3ca46e54c303d07fec088f6ad5e.png) and the other one is represented as a finite fraction of height $ n $ . Check if they are equal.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two space-separated integers $ p,q $ $ (1<=q<=p<=10^{18}) $ — the numerator and the denominator of the first fraction.

The second line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=90) $ — the height of the second fraction. The third line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ $ (1<=a_{i}<=10^{18}) $ — the continued fraction.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

### 输出格式

Print "YES" if these fractions are equal and "NO" otherwise.
