# Analyzing Polyline

## 题目描述

As Valeric and Valerko were watching one of the last Euro Championship games in a sports bar, they broke a mug. Of course, the guys paid for it but the barman said that he will let them watch football in his bar only if they help his son complete a programming task. The task goes like that.

Let's consider a set of functions of the following form:

It's easy to show that in this case the graph $ s(x) $ is a polyline. You are given $ n $ functions of the given type, your task is to find the number of angles that do not equal 180 degrees, in the graph $ s(x) $ , that is the sum of the given functions.Valeric and Valerko really want to watch the next Euro Championship game, so they asked you to help them.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5}) $ — the number of functions. Each of the following $ n $ lines contains two space-separated integer numbers $ k_{i},b_{i} $ $ (-10^{9}<=k_{i},b_{i}<=10^{9}) $ that determine the $ i $ -th function.

### 输出格式

Print a single number — the number of angles that do not equal 180 degrees in the graph of the polyline that equals the sum of the given functions.
