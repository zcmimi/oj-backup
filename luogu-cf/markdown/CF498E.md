# Stairs and Lines

## 题意翻译

有⼀排阶梯，每列的⾼度不减，且是1到7的整数，⾼度为i的阶梯有w_i个，现在你需要给阶梯的某些边缘上⾊，要求边缘必须上⾊，且不能框出1∗1的⼩正⽅形。求⽅案数对10^9+7取模。

## 题目描述

You are given a figure on a grid representing stairs consisting of 7 steps. The width of the stair on height $ i $ is $ w_{i} $ squares. Formally, the figure is created by consecutively joining rectangles of size $ w_{i}×i $ so that the $ w_{i} $ sides lie on one straight line. Thus, for example, if all $ w_{i}=1 $ , the figure will look like that (different colors represent different rectangles):

The borders of the squares lying on the border of the figure should be considered painted. The ways that differ with the figure's rotation should be considered distinct.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The single line of the input contains 7 numbers $ w_{1},w_{2},...,w_{7} $ ( $ 0<=w_{i}<=10^{5} $ ). It is guaranteed that at least one of the $ w_{i} $ 's isn't equal to zero.

### 输出格式

In the single line of the output display a single number — the answer to the problem modulo $ 10^{9}+7 $ .
