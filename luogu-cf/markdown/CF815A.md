## 题目描述

On the way to school, Karen became fixated on the puzzle game on her phone!

![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF815A/69d9eed46962e3cdadeae01ef67d1e4bd4bac050.png)The game is played as follows. In each level, you have a grid with $ n $ rows and $ m $ columns. Each cell originally contains the number $ 0 $ .

One move consists of choosing one row or column, and adding $ 1 $ to all of the cells in that row or column.

To win the level, after all the moves, the number in the cell at the $ i $ -th row and $ j $ -th column should be equal to $ g_{i,j} $ .

Karen is stuck on one level, and wants to know a way to beat this level using the minimum number of moves. Please, help her with this task!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integers, $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n,m<=100 $ ), the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, respectively.

The next $ n $ lines each contain $ m $ integers. In particular, the $ j $ -th integer in the $ i $ -th of these rows contains $ g_{i,j} $ ( $ 0<=g_{i,j}<=500 $ ).

### 输出格式

If there is an error and it is actually not possible to beat the level, output a single integer -1.

Otherwise, on the first line, output a single integer $ k $ , the minimum number of moves necessary to beat the level.

The next $ k $ lines should each contain one of the following, describing the moves in the order they must be done:

- row $ x $ , ( $ 1<=x<=n $ ) describing a move of the form "choose the $ x $ -th row".

- col $ x $ , ( $ 1<=x<=m $ ) describing a move of the form "choose the $ x $ -th column".

If there are multiple optimal solutions, output any one of them.

## 说明

In the first test case, Karen has a grid with $ 3 $ rows and $ 5 $ columns. She can perform the following $ 4 $ moves to beat the level:

It is clear that it is impossible to beat the level; performing any move will create three $ 1 $ s on the grid, but it is required to only have one $ 1 $ in the center.

In the third test case, Karen has a grid with $ 3 $ rows and $ 3 $ columns. She can perform the following $ 3 $ moves to beat the level:
