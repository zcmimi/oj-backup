In one minute, Pasha can make some hamster ether sit down or stand up. How many minutes will he need to get what he wants if he acts optimally well?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=200 $ ; $ n $ is even). The next line contains $ n $ characters without spaces. These characters describe the hamsters' position: the $ i $ -th character equals 'X', if the $ i $ -th hamster in the row is standing, and 'x', if he is sitting.

### 输出格式

In the first line, print a single integer — the minimum required number of minutes. In the second line, print a string that describes the hamsters' position after Pasha makes the required changes. If there are multiple optimal positions, print any of them.
