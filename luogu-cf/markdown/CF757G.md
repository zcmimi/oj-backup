## 题目描述

Whoa! You did a great job helping Team Rocket who managed to capture all the Pokemons sent by Bash. Meowth, part of Team Rocket, having already mastered the human language, now wants to become a master in programming as well. He agrees to free the Pokemons if Bash can answer his questions.

Initially, Meowth gives Bash a weighted tree containing $ n $ nodes and a sequence $ a_{1},a_{2}...,a_{n} $ which is a permutation of $ 1,2,...,n $ . Now, Mewoth makes $ q $ queries of one of the following forms:

- 1 l r v: meaning Bash should report ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF757G/ea8253b2e126f0f9a4f7e577c28110ed4a318c5a.png), where $ dist(a,b) $ is the length of the shortest path from node $ a $ to node $ b $ in the given tree.

- 2 x: meaning Bash should swap $ a_{x} $ and $ a_{x+1} $ in the given sequence. This new sequence is used for later queries.

Help Bash to answer the questions!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=2·10^{5} $ , $ 1<=q<=2·10^{5} $ ) — the number of nodes in the tree and the number of queries, respectively.

The next line contains $ n $ space-separated integers — the sequence $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ which is a permutation of $ 1,2,...,n $ .

Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contain three space-separated integers $ u $ , $ v $ , and $ w $ denoting that there exists an undirected edge between node $ u $ and node $ v $ of weight $ w $ , ( $ 1<=u,v<=n $ , $ u≠v $ , $ 1<=w<=10^{6} $ ). It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

Each query consists of two lines. First line contains single integer $ t $ , indicating the type of the query. Next line contains the description of the query:

- t = 1: Second line contains three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ ( $ 1<=a,b,c&lt;2^{30} $ ) using which $ l $ , $ r $ and $ v $ can be generated using the formula given below:

- t = 2: Second line contains single integer $ a $ ( $ 1<=a&lt;2^{30} $ ) using which $ x $ can be generated using the formula given below:

- ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF757G/eb2a03b6eebdb7c4867abe4c7844cc3adf9f4a53.png).

The $ ans_{i} $ is the answer for the $ i $ -th query, assume that $ ans_{0}=0 $ . If the $ i $ -th query is of type 2 then $ ans_{i} $ = $ ans_{i-1} $ . It is guaranteed that:

- for each query of type 1: $ 1<=l<=r<=n $ , $ 1<=v<=n $ ,

- for each query of type 2: $ 1<=x<=n-1 $ .

The ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF757G/4298d47c0191af3c0a3103f431751061bc7e2362.png) operation means bitwise exclusive OR.

### 输出格式

For each query of type $ 1 $ , output a single integer in a separate line, denoting the answer to the query.
