# Seating On Bus

## 题目描述

Consider $ 2n $ rows of the seats in a bus. $ n $ rows of the seats on the left and $ n $ rows of the seats on the right. Each row can be filled by two people. So the total capacity of the bus is $ 4n $ .

Consider that $ m $ ( $ m<=4n $ ) people occupy the seats in the bus. The passengers entering the bus are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ m $ (in the order of their entering the bus). The pattern of the seat occupation is as below:

$ 1 $ -st row left window seat, $ 1 $ -st row right window seat, $ 2 $ -nd row left window seat, $ 2 $ -nd row right window seat, ... , $ n $ -th row left window seat, $ n $ -th row right window seat.

After occupying all the window seats (for $ m&gt;2n $ ) the non-window seats are occupied:

$ 1 $ -st row left non-window seat, $ 1 $ -st row right non-window seat, ... , $ n $ -th row left non-window seat, $ n $ -th row right non-window seat.

All the passengers go to a single final destination. In the final destination, the passengers get off in the given order.

$ 1 $ -st row left non-window seat, $ 1 $ -st row left window seat, $ 1 $ -st row right non-window seat, $ 1 $ -st row right window seat, ... , $ n $ -th row left non-window seat, $ n $ -th row left window seat, $ n $ -th row right non-window seat, $ n $ -th row right window seat.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line contains two integers, $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=100,1<=m<=4n $ ) — the number of pairs of rows and the number of passengers.

### 输出格式
