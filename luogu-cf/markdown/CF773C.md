# Prairie Partition

## 题目描述

It can be shown that any positive integer $ x $ can be uniquely represented as $ x=1+2+4+...+2^{k-1}+r $ , where $ k $ and $ r $ are integers, $ k>=0 $ , $ 0&lt;r<=2^{k} $ . Let's call that representation prairie partition of $ x $ .

For example, the prairie partitions of $ 12 $ , $ 17 $ , $ 7 $ and $ 1 $ are:

$ 12=1+2+4+5 $ , $ 17=1+2+4+8+2 $ ,

$ 7=1+2+4 $ ,

$ 1=1 $ .

Alice took a sequence of positive integers (possibly with repeating elements), replaced every element with the sequence of summands in its prairie partition, arranged the resulting numbers in non-decreasing order and gave them to Borys. Now Borys wonders how many elements Alice's original sequence could contain. Find all possible options!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of numbers given from Alice to Borys.

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{12} $ ; $ a_{1}<=a_{2}<=...<=a_{n} $ ) — the numbers given from Alice to Borys.

### 输出格式

Output, in increasing order, all possible values of $ m $ such that there exists a sequence of positive integers of length $ m $ such that if you replace every element with the summands in its prairie partition and arrange the resulting numbers in non-decreasing order, you will get the sequence given in the input.

If there are no such values of $ m $ , output a single integer -1.

## 说明

In the first example, Alice could get the input sequence from $ [6,20] $ as the original sequence.

In the second example, Alice's original sequence could be either $ [4,5] $ or $ [3,3,3] $ .
