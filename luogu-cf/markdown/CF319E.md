# Ping-Pong

## 题目描述

In this problem at each moment you have a set of intervals. You can move from interval $ (a,b) $ from our set to interval $ (c,d) $ from our set if and only if $ c

< a < d $ or $ c < b < d $ . Also there is a path from interval $ I_{1} $ from our set to interval $ I_{2} $ from our set if there is a sequence of successive moves starting from $ I_{1} $ so that we can reach $ I_{2} $ .

Your program should handle the queries of the following two types:

1. "1 x y" $ (x&lt;y) $ — add the new interval $ (x,y) $ to the set of intervals. The length of the new interval is guaranteed to be strictly greater than all the previous intervals.

2. "2 a b" $ (a≠b) $ — answer the question: is there a path from $ a $ -th (one-based) added interval to $ b $ -th (one-based) added interval?

Answer all the queries. Note, that initially you have an empty set of intervals.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains integer $ n $ denoting the number of queries, $ (1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}) $ . Each of the following lines contains a query as described above. All numbers in the input are integers and don't exceed $ 10^{9} $ by their absolute value.

It's guaranteed that all queries are correct.

### 输出格式

For each query of the second type print "YES" or "NO" on a separate line depending on the answer.
