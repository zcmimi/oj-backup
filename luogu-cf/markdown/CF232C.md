# Doe Graphs

## 题意翻译

Doe以她自己的名字来命名下面的无向图

D(0)是只有一个编号为1的结点的图.

D(1)是只有两个编号分别为1和2的点与一条连接这两个点的边的图.

D(n)以如下方法构造

将D(n-2)中所有点的编号加上|D(n-1)|

在点|D(n-1)|与点|D(n-1)|+1之间连边。

在点|D(n-1)|+1与点1之间连边

现在Doe已经构造出了D(n)(n≤100),她会多次询问你在这张图中ab两点间的最短路

## 题目描述

John Doe decided that some mathematical object must be named after him. So he invented the Doe graphs. The Doe graphs are a family of undirected graphs, each of them is characterized by a single non-negative number — its order.

We'll denote a graph of order $ k $ as $ D(k) $ , and we'll denote the number of vertices in the graph $ D(k) $ as $ |D(k)| $ . Then let's define the Doe graphs as follows:

- $ D(0) $ consists of a single vertex, that has number $ 1 $ .

- $ D(1) $ consists of two vertices with numbers $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ , connected by an edge.

- $ D(n) $ for $ n>=2 $ is obtained from graphs $ D(n-1) $ and $ D(n-2) $ . $ D(n-1) $ and $ D(n-2) $ are joined in one graph, at that numbers of all vertices of graph $ D(n-2) $ increase by $ |D(n-1)| $ (for example, vertex number $ 1 $ of graph $ D(n-2) $ becomes vertex number $ 1+|D(n-1)| $ ). After that two edges are added to the graph: the first one goes between vertices with numbers $ |D(n-1)| $ and $ |D(n-1)|+1 $ , the second one goes between vertices with numbers $ |D(n-1)|+1 $ and $ 1 $ . Note that the definition of graph $ D(n) $ implies, that $ D(n) $ is a connected graph, its vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ |D(n)| $ .

However, your task is to answer queries of finding the shortest-length path between the vertices $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ in the graph $ D(n) $ .

A path between a pair of vertices $ u $ and $ v $ in the graph is a sequence of vertices $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ x_{k} $ $ (k&gt;1) $ such, that $ x_{1}=u $ , $ x_{k}=v $ , and for any $ i $ $ (i&lt;k) $ vertices $ x_{i} $ and $ x_{i+1} $ are connected by a graph edge. The length of path $ x_{1} $ , $ x_{2} $ , $ ... $ , $ x_{k} $ is number $ (k-1) $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ t $ and $ n $ ( $ 1<=t<=10^{5}; 1<=n<=10^{3} $ ) — the number of queries and the order of the given graph. The $ i $ -th of the next $ t $ lines contains two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=10^{16} $ , $ a_{i}≠b_{i} $ ) — numbers of two vertices in the $ i $ -th query. It is guaranteed that $ a_{i},b_{i}<=|D(n)| $ .

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

### 输出格式

For each query print a single integer on a single line — the length of the shortest path between vertices $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ . Print the answers to the queries in the order, in which the queries are given in the input.
