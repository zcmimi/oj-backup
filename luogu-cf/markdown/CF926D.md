## 题目描述

The input consists of $ 6 $ lines. Each line describes one row of desks, starting from the closest to the blackboard. Each line is given in the following format: two characters, each is '\*' or '.' — the description of the left desk in the current row; a character '-' — the aisle; two characters, each is '\*' or '.' — the description of the center desk in the current row; a character '-' — the aisle; two characters, each is '\*' or '.' — the description of the right desk in the current row. So, the length of each of the six lines is $ 8 $ .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one vacant place in the classroom.
