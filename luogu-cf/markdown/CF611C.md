# New Year and Domino

## 题意翻译

给你一个h行w列的矩阵，‘.’表示空位，‘#’表示非空位，每次询问给出一个矩形左上顶点和右下顶点，问有多少种方案将一张$1*2$的“骨牌”摆进这个子矩阵中（每个骨牌会覆盖相邻的两个空位）

## 题目描述

They say "years are like dominoes, tumbling one after the other". But would a year fit into a grid? I don't think so.

Limak is a little polar bear who loves to play. He has recently got a rectangular grid with $ h $ rows and $ w $ columns. Each cell is a square, either empty (denoted by '.') or forbidden (denoted by '\#'). Rows are numbered $ 1 $ through $ h $ from top to bottom. Columns are numbered $ 1 $ through $ w $ from left to right.

Also, Limak has a single domino. He wants to put it somewhere in a grid. A domino will occupy exactly two adjacent cells, located either in one row or in one column. Both adjacent cells must be empty and must be inside a grid.

Limak needs more fun and thus he is going to consider some queries. In each query he chooses some rectangle and wonders, how many way are there to put a single domino inside of the chosen rectangle?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $ h $ and $ w $ ( $ 1<=h,w<=500 $ ) – the number of rows and the number of columns, respectively.

The next $ h $ lines describe a grid. Each line contains a string of the length $ w $ . Each character is either '.' or '\#' — denoting an empty or forbidden cell, respectively.

The next line contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=100000 $ ) — the number of queries.

Each of the next $ q $ lines contains four integers $ r1_{i} $ , $ c1_{i} $ , $ r2_{i} $ , $ c2_{i} $ ( $ 1<=r1_{i}<=r2_{i}<=h,1<=c1_{i}<=c2_{i}<=w $ ) — the $ i $ -th query. Numbers $ r1_{i} $ and $ c1_{i} $ denote the row and the column (respectively) of the upper left cell of the rectangle. Numbers $ r2_{i} $ and $ c2_{i} $ denote the row and the column (respectively) of the bottom right cell of the rectangle.

### 输出格式

Print $ q $ integers, $ i $ -th should be equal to the number of ways to put a single domino inside the $ i $ -th rectangle.
