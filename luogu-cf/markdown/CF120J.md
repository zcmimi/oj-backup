# Minimum Sum

## 题目描述

You are given a set of $ n $ vectors on a plane. For each vector you are allowed to multiply any of its coordinates by -1. Thus, each vector $ v_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i}) $ can be transformed into one of the following four vectors:

- $ v_{i}^{1}=(x_{i},y_{i}) $ ,

- $ v_{i}^{2}=(-x_{i},y_{i}) $ ,

- $ v_{i}^{3}=(x_{i},-y_{i}) $ ,

- $ v_{i}^{4}=(-x_{i},-y_{i}) $ .

You should find two vectors from the set and determine which of their coordinates should be multiplied by -1 so that the absolute value of the sum of the resulting vectors was minimally possible. More formally, you should choose two vectors $ v_{i} $ , $ v_{j} $ ( $ 1<=i,j<=n,i≠j $ ) and two numbers $ k_{1} $ , $ k_{2} $ ( $ 1<=k_{1},k_{2}<=4 $ ), so that the value of the expression $ |v_{i}^{k_{1}}+v_{j}^{k_{2}}| $ were minimum.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=10^{5} $ ). Then $ n $ lines contain vectors as pairs of integers " $ x_{i} $ $ y_{i} $ " ( $ -10000<=x_{i},y_{i}<=10000 $ ), one pair per line.

### 输出格式

Print on the first line four space-separated numbers " $ i $ $ k_{1} $ $ j $ $ k_{2} $ " — the answer to the problem. If there are several variants the absolute value of whose sums is minimum, you can print any of them.

## 说明

A sum of two vectors $ v=(x_{v},y_{v}) $ and $ u=(x_{u},y_{u}) $ is vector $ s=v+u=(x_{v}+x_{u},y_{v}+y_{u}) $ .

An absolute value of vector $ v=(x,y) $ is number ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF120J/f38b71729f5e7990a499daa93821211f59c1e021.png).

In the second sample there are several valid answers, such as:

(3 1 4 2), (3 1 4 4), (3 4 4 1), (3 4 4 3), (4 1 3 2), (4 1 3 4), (4 2 3 1).
