# Arpa’s abnormal DNA and Mehrdad’s deep interest

## 题意翻译

给定两个字符串$S,T$，定义$R_i$表示在$S$的第$i$个和第$i+1$个字符之间插入$T$得到的字符串($R_0$即加在开头，$R_n$即加在结尾)。

$Q$个询问形如$(l,r,k,x,y)$，表示询问$l\leq i\leq r,x\leq (i\mod k) \leq y$中字典序最小的$R_i$是哪个$i$

$|S|,|T|,Q\leq 10^5$

## 题目描述

All of us know that girls in Arpa’s land are... ok, you’ve got the idea :D

Anyone knows that Arpa isn't a normal man, he is ... well, sorry, I can't explain it more. Mehrdad is interested about the reason, so he asked Sipa, one of the best biology scientists in Arpa's land, for help. Sipa has a DNA editor.

![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741E/f1c979b8a7bb7c441f45ba8aff5ff742219a18d6.png)Sipa put Arpa under the DNA editor. DNA editor showed Arpa's DNA as a string $ S $ consisting of $ n $ lowercase English letters. Also Sipa has another DNA $ T $ consisting of lowercase English letters that belongs to a normal man.

Now there are $ (n+1) $ options to change Arpa's DNA, numbered from $ 0 $ to $ n $ . $ i $ -th of them is to put $ T $ between $ i $ -th and $ (i+1) $ -th characters of $ S $ ( $ 0<=i<=n $ ). If $ i=0 $ , $ T $ will be put before $ S $ , and if $ i=n $ , it will be put after $ S $ .

Mehrdad wants to choose the most interesting option for Arpa's DNA among these $ n+1 $ options. DNA $ A $ is more interesting than $ B $ if $ A $ is lexicographically smaller than $ B $ . Mehrdad asked Sipa $ q $ questions:

Given integers $ l,r,k,x,y $ , what is the most interesting option if we only consider such options $ i $ that $ l<=i<=r $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741E/efffa8af9d832e95e5a4f5bfacc794d15b67b9f5.png)? If there are several most interesting options, Mehrdad wants to know one with the smallest number $ i $ .

Since Sipa is a biology scientist but not a programmer, you should help him.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains strings $ S $ , $ T $ and integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=|S|,|T|,q<=10^{5} $ ) — Arpa's DNA, the DNA of a normal man, and the number of Mehrdad's questions. The strings $ S $ and $ T $ consist only of small English letters.

Next $ q $ lines describe the Mehrdad's questions. Each of these lines contain five integers $ l,r,k,x,y $ ( $ 0<=l<=r<=n $ , $ 1<=k<=n $ , $ 0<=x<=y&lt;k $ ).

### 输出格式

Print $ q $ integers. The $ j $ -th of them should be the number $ i $ of the most interesting option among those that satisfy the conditions of the $ j $ -th question. If there is no option $ i $ satisfying the conditions in some question, print -1.

## 说明

Explanation of first sample case:

In the first question Sipa has two options: dabc ( $ i=0 $ ) and abdc ( $ i=2 $ ). The latter (abcd) is better than abdc, so answer is $ 2 $ .

In the last question there is no $ i $ such that $ 0<=i<=1 $ and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF741E/1a019882e80a687b78569abfa96818d1e14ebbcd.png).
