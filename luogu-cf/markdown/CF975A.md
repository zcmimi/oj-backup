# Aramic script

## 题目描述

In Aramic language words can only represent objects.

Words in Aramic have special properties:

- A word is a root if it does not contain the same letter more than once.

- A root and all its permutations represent the same object.

- The root $ x $ of a word $ y $ is the word that contains all letters that appear in $ y $ in a way that each letter appears once. For example, the root of "aaaa", "aa", "aaa" is "a", the root of "aabb", "bab", "baabb", "ab" is "ab".

- Any word in Aramic represents the same object as its root.

You have an ancient script in Aramic. What is the number of different objects mentioned in the script?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 10^3 $ ) — the number of words in the script.

The second line contains $ n $ words $ s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n $ — the script itself. The length of each string does not exceed $ 10^3 $ .

It is guaranteed that all characters of the strings are small latin letters.
