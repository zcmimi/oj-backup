## 题意翻译

现在有一朵长在水中的莲花，它露出水面的长度为H厘米（不包括花朵）

有人把它拽了L 厘米，使得茎秆部分恰好完全浸没于水中

现在给你H和L，请求水的深度

## 题目描述

While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $ H $ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $ L $ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.

Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $ A $ , i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $ A $ ?

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line contains two integers $ H $ and $ L $ ( $ 1 \le H < L \le 10^{6} $ ).

### 输出格式

Print a single number — the depth of the lake at point $ A $ . The absolute or relative error should not exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .

Formally, let your answer be $ A $ , and the jury's answer be $ B $ . Your answer is accepted if and only if $ \frac{|A - B|}{\max{(1, |B|)}} \le 10^{-6} $ .
