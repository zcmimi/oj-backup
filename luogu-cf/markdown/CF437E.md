# The Child and Polygon

## 题意翻译

给出$n$个点，求这个多边形的三角剖分的方案数

mod 1e9+7

## 题目描述

This time our child has a simple polygon. He has to find the number of ways to split the polygon into non-degenerate triangles, each way must satisfy the following requirements:

- each vertex of each triangle is one of the polygon vertex;

- each side of the polygon must be the side of exactly one triangle;

- the area of intersection of every two triangles equals to zero, and the sum of all areas of triangles equals to the area of the polygon;

- each triangle must be completely inside the polygon;

- each side of each triangle must contain exactly two vertices of the polygon.

The picture below depicts an example of a correct splitting.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains one integer $ n $ $ (3<=n<=200) $ — the number of vertices of the polygon. Then follow $ n $ lines, each line containing two integers. The $ i $ -th line contains $ x_{i},y_{i} $ $ (|x_{i}|,|y_{i}|<=10^{7}) $ — the $ i $ -th vertex of the polygon in clockwise or counterclockwise order.

It's guaranteed that the polygon is simple.

### 输出格式

Output the number of ways modulo $ 1000000007 $ $ (10^{9}+7) $ .

## 说明

In the first sample, there are two possible splittings:
