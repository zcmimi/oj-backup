# Magic Formulas

## 题目描述

People in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much. You can see some of them below.

Imagine you are given a sequence of positive integer numbers $ p_{1} $ , $ p_{2} $ , ..., $ p_{n} $ . Lets write down some magic formulas:

The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by "^", in Pascal — by "xor".

People in the Tomskaya region like magic formulas very much, but they don't like to calculate them! Therefore you are given the sequence $ p $ , calculate the value of $ Q $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains the only integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{6} $ ). The next line contains $ n $ integers: $ p_{1},p_{2},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 0<=p_{i}<=2·10^{9} $ ).

### 输出格式

The only line of output should contain a single integer — the value of $ Q $ .
