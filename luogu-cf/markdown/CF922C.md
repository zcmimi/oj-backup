## 题目描述

Imp is watching a documentary about cave painting.

Imp rapidly proposed a guess that they are the remainders of division of a number $ n $ by all integers $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ k $ . Unfortunately, there are too many integers to analyze for Imp.

Imp wants you to check whether all these remainders are distinct. Formally, he wants to check, if all ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF922C/39f2e5c509199205284370aee9d1f8146afae4b5.png), $ 1<=i<=k $ , are distinct, i. e. there is no such pair $ (i,j) $ that:

- $ 1 \leq i < j \leq k $ ,

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line contains two integers $ n $ , $ k $ $ (1<=n,k<=10^{18}) $ .

### 输出格式

Print "Yes", if all the remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

You can print each letter in arbitrary case (lower or upper).
