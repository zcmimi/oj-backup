# Periodical Numbers

## 题目描述

A non-empty string $ s $ is called binary, if it consists only of characters "0" and "1". Let's number the characters of binary string $ s $ from 1 to the string's length and let's denote the $ i $ -th character in string $ s $ as $ s_{i} $ .

Binary string $ s $ with length $ n $ is periodical, if there is an integer $ 1<=k&lt;n $ such that:

- $ k $ is a divisor of number $ n $

- for all $ 1<=i<=n-k $ , the following condition fulfills: $ s_{i}=s_{i+k} $

For example, binary strings "101010" and "11" are periodical and "10" and "10010" are not.

A positive integer $ x $ is periodical, if its binary representation (without leading zeroes) is a periodic string.

Your task is to calculate, how many periodic numbers are in the interval from $ l $ to $ r $ (both ends are included).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The single input line contains two integers $ l $ and $ r $ ( $ 1<=l<=r<=10^{18} $ ). The numbers are separated by a space.

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer, showing how many periodic numbers are in the interval from $ l $ to $ r $ (both ends are included).
