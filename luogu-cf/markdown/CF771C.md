# Bear and Tree Jumps

## 题意翻译

有一颗n个结点且有n-1条边的无根树

一只熊可以从当前节点可以跳到任何与当前节点距离**不超过k**的节点

定义$f(u,v)$为熊从u点到v点所需的最少跳跃次数，那么，对于树上的所有点对$(u,v)$，$f(u,v)$的总和是多少。

**注意：**

$(u,v)$和$(v,u)$视作同一个点对，只计算一次答案

## 题目描述

A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles. The distance between two vertices is the number of edges in a simple path between them.

Limak is a little polar bear. He lives in a tree that consists of $ n $ vertices, numbered $ 1 $ through $ n $ .

Limak recently learned how to jump. He can jump from a vertex to any vertex within distance at most $ k $ .

For a pair of vertices $ (s,t) $ we define $ f(s,t) $ as the minimum number of jumps Limak needs to get from $ s $ to $ t $ . Your task is to find the sum of $ f(s,t) $ over all pairs of vertices $ (s,t) $ such that $ s&lt;t $ .

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 2<=n<=200000 $ , $ 1<=k<=5 $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum allowed jump distance respectively.

The next $ n-1 $ lines describe edges in the tree. The $ i $ -th of those lines contains two integers $ a_{i} $ and $ b_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i},b_{i}<=n $ ) — the indices on vertices connected with $ i $ -th edge.

It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

### 输出格式

Print one integer, denoting the sum of $ f(s,t) $ over all pairs of vertices $ (s,t) $ such that $ s&lt;t $ .

## 说明

In the first sample, the given tree has $ 6 $ vertices and it's displayed on the drawing below. Limak can jump to any vertex within distance at most $ 2 $ . For example, from the vertex $ 5 $ he can jump to any of vertices: $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ (well, he can also jump to the vertex $ 5 $ itself).

For $ 5 $ of those pairs Limak would need two jumps: $ (1,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6),(5,6) $ . For other $ 10 $ pairs one jump is enough. So, the answer is $ 5·2+10·1=20 $ .

In the third sample, Limak can jump between every two vertices directly. There are $ 3 $ pairs of vertices $ (s&lt;t) $ , so the answer is $ 3·1=3 $ .
