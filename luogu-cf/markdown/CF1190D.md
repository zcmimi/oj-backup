# Tokitsukaze and Strange Rectangle

## 题目描述

There are $ n $ points on the plane, the $ i $ -th of which is at $ (x_i, y_i) $ . Tokitsukaze wants to draw a strange rectangular area and pick all the points in the area.

The strange area is enclosed by three lines, $ x = l $ , $ y = a $ and $ x = r $ , as its left side, its bottom side and its right side respectively, where $ l $ , $ r $ and $ a $ can be any real numbers satisfying that $ l < r $ . The upper side of the area is boundless, which you can regard as a line parallel to the $ x $ -axis at infinity. The following figure shows a strange rectangular area.

Tokitsukaze wants to know how many different non-empty sets she can obtain by picking all the points in a strange rectangular area, where we think two sets are different if there exists at least one point in one set of them but not in the other.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 $ ) — the number of points on the plane.

The $ i $ -th of the next $ n $ lines contains two integers $ x_i $ , $ y_i $ ( $ 1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 $ ) — the coordinates of the $ i $ -th point.

All points are distinct.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the number of different non-empty sets of points she can obtain.

## 说明

For the first example, there is exactly one set having $ k $ points for $ k = 1, 2, 3 $ , so the total number is $ 3 $ .

For the second example, the numbers of sets having $ k $ points for $ k = 1, 2, 3 $ are $ 3 $ , $ 2 $ , $ 1 $ respectively, and their sum is $ 6 $ .

For the third example, as the following figure shows, there are

- $ 2 $ sets having one point;

- $ 3 $ sets having two points;

- $ 1 $ set having four points.

Therefore, the number of different non-empty sets in this example is $ 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 = 6 $ .
