# Jamie and Tree

## 题意翻译

有一棵n个节点的有根树，标号为1-n，你需要维护以下三种操作

1.给定一个点v，将整颗树的根变为v

2.给定两个点u, v，将lca(u, v)所在的子树都加上x

3.给定一个点v，你需要回答以v所在的子树的权值和

## 题目描述

To your surprise, Jamie is the final boss! Ehehehe.

Jamie has given you a tree with $ n $ vertices, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ . Initially, the root of the tree is the vertex with number $ 1 $ . Also, each vertex has a value on it.

Jamie also gives you three types of queries on the tree:

$ 1\ v $ — Change the tree's root to vertex with number $ v $ .

$ 2\ u\ v\ x $ — For each vertex in the subtree of smallest size that contains $ u $ and $ v $ , add $ x $ to its value.

$ 3\ v $ — Find sum of values of vertices in the subtree of vertex with number $ v $ .

A subtree of vertex $ v $ is a set of vertices such that $ v $ lies on shortest path from this vertex to root of the tree. Pay attention that subtree of a vertex can change after changing the tree's root.

Show your strength in programming to Jamie by performing the queries accurately!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5},1<=q<=10^{5} $ ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries to process respectively.

The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ -10^{8}<=a_{i}<=10^{8} $ ) — initial values of the vertices.

Next $ n-1 $ lines contains two space-separated integers $ u_{i},v_{i} $ ( $ 1<=u_{i},v_{i}<=n $ ) describing edge between vertices $ u_{i} $ and $ v_{i} $ in the tree.

The following $ q $ lines describe the queries.

Each query has one of following formats depending on its type:

$ 1\ v $ ( $ 1<=v<=n $ ) for queries of the first type.

$ 2\ u\ v\ x $ ( $ 1<=u,v<=n,-10^{8}<=x<=10^{8} $ ) for queries of the second type.

$ 3\ v $ ( $ 1<=v<=n $ ) for queries of the third type.

All numbers in queries' descriptions are integers.

The queries must be carried out in the given order. It is guaranteed that the tree is valid.

### 输出格式

For each query of the third type, output the required answer. It is guaranteed that at least one query of the third type is given by Jamie.
