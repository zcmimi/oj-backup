# Hexagons

## 题目描述

Ayrat is looking for the perfect code. He decided to start his search from an infinite field tiled by hexagons. For convenience the coordinate system is introduced, take a look at the picture to see how the coordinates of hexagon are defined:

He started at point $ (0,0) $ and is moving along the spiral (see second picture). Sometimes he forgets where he is now. Help Ayrat determine his location after $ n $ moves.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The only line of the input contains integer $ n $ ( $ 0<=n<=10^{18} $ ) — the number of Ayrat's moves.

### 输出格式

Print two integers $ x $ and $ y $ — current coordinates of Ayrat coordinates.
