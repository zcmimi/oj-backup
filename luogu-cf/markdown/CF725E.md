# Too Much Money

## 题意翻译

 题意

给定一件c元的物品，以及n个硬币，其中硬币的面值可以时任意价格，第i个硬币面值为w[i]，现在要用这n个硬币恰好凑出c元。有这样一种贪心策略：初始选择集合S为空，每次选择不超过剩余所需价值的最大面值硬币并将其加入S中。 但是出题人表示不服，要卡掉这个算法。 他要加入任意数量的硬币，每个硬币可以是任意面值，使得最后算法不能得出合法的S集合。同时他想最小化加入硬币的总价值。

* 【输入数据】

第一行两个正整数c,n。第二行n个正整数w[i]。

* 【输出数据】

输出该组数据最小代价，如果出题人永远无法卡掉这个算法，那么输出“Greed is good”。

## 题目描述

Alfred wants to buy a toy moose that costs $ c $ dollars. The store doesn’t give change, so he must give the store exactly $ c $ dollars, no more and no less. He has $ n $ coins. To make $ c $ dollars from his coins, he follows the following algorithm: let $ S $ be the set of coins being used. $ S $ is initially empty. Alfred repeatedly adds to $ S $ the highest-valued coin he has such that the total value of the coins in $ S $ after adding the coin doesn’t exceed $ c $ . If there is no such coin, and the value of the coins in $ S $ is still less than $ c $ , he gives up and goes home. Note that Alfred never removes a coin from $ S $ after adding it.

As a programmer, you might be aware that Alfred’s algorithm can fail even when there is a set of coins with value exactly $ c $ . For example, if Alfred has one coin worth $3, one coin worth $4, and two coins worth $5, and the moose costs $12, then Alfred will add both of the $5 coins to $ S $ and then give up, since adding any other coin would cause the value of the coins in $ S $ to exceed $12. Of course, Alfred could instead combine one $3 coin, one $4 coin, and one $5 coin to reach the total.

Bob tried to convince Alfred that his algorithm was flawed, but Alfred didn’t believe him. Now Bob wants to give Alfred some coins (in addition to those that Alfred already has) such that Alfred’s algorithm fails. Bob can give Alfred any number of coins of any denomination (subject to the constraint that each coin must be worth a positive integer number of dollars). There can be multiple coins of a single denomination. He would like to minimize the total value of the coins he gives Alfred. Please find this minimum value. If there is no solution, print "Greed is good". You can assume that the answer, if it exists, is positive. In other words, Alfred's algorithm will work if Bob doesn't give him any coins.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains $ c $ ( $ 1<=c<=200000 $ ) — the price Alfred wants to pay. The second line contains $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=200000 $ ) — the number of coins Alfred initially has. Then $ n $ lines follow, each containing a single integer $ x $ ( $ 1<=x<=c $ ) representing the value of one of Alfred's coins.

### 输出格式

If there is a solution, print the minimum possible total value of the coins in a solution. Otherwise, print "Greed is good" (without quotes).

## 说明

In the first sample, Bob should give Alfred a single coin worth $5. This creates the situation described in the problem statement.

In the second sample, there is no set of coins that will cause Alfred's algorithm to fail.
