# Color the Carpet

## 题目描述

Even polar bears feel cold when lying on the ice. Therefore, a polar bear Alice is going to make a carpet. The carpet can be viewed as a grid with height $ h $ and width $ w $ . Then the grid is divided into $ h×w $ squares. Alice is going to assign one of $ k $ different colors to each square. The colors are numbered from 1 to $ k $ . She may choose not to use all of the colors.

However, there are some restrictions. For every two adjacent squares (squares that shares an edge) $ x $ and $ y $ , there is a color constraint in one of the forms:

- $ color(x)=color(y) $ , or

- $ color(x)≠color(y) $ .

Example of the color constraints:

It is not always possible to satisfy all color constraints. Fortunately, she will still be happy if at least ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/c7b5e8f543c3882ba6f2a662e01781b4de30f8c7.png) of the color constraints are satisfied.

If she has $ 4 $ colors she can color the carpet in the following way:

Your task is to help her color the carpet.

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains three integers $ h,w,k $ $ (2<=h,w<=1000,1<=k<=w·h) $ .

The next $ 2h-1 $ lines describe the color constraints from top to bottom, left to right. They contain $ w-1,w,w-1,w,...,w-1 $ characters respectively. Each color constraint is represented by a character "E" or "N", where "E" means " $ = $ " and "N" means " $ ≠ $ ".

The color constraints listed in the order they are depicted on the picture.

### 输出格式

If there is a coloring that satisfies at least ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF297D/c7b5e8f543c3882ba6f2a662e01781b4de30f8c7.png) of the color constraints, print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In each of the next $ h $ lines, print $ w $ integers describing the coloring.

Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).
