# Binary Matrix

## 题目描述

You are given a matrix of size $ n×m $ . Each element of the matrix is either 1 or 0. You have to determine the number of connected components consisting of 1's. Two cells belong to the same component if they have a common border, and both elements in these cells are 1's.

Note that the memory limit is unusual!

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains two numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 1<=n<=2^{12} $ , $ 4<=m<=2^{14} $ ) — the number of rows and columns, respectively. It is guaranteed that $ m $ is divisible by 4.

Then the representation of matrix follows. Each of $ n $ next lines contains ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF884E/815399ca6efd4ff30245f3c2c7ed5eecede476cc.png) one-digit hexadecimal numbers (that is, these numbers can be represented either as digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ or as uppercase Latin letters from $ A $ to $ F $ ). Binary representation of each of these numbers denotes next $ 4 $ elements of the matrix in the corresponding row. For example, if the number $ B $ is given, then the corresponding elements are 1011, and if the number is $ 5 $ , then the corresponding elements are 0101.

Elements are not separated by whitespaces.

### 输出格式

## 说明

In the first example the matrix is:

`000110101000`It is clear that it has three components.

The second example:

`0101111111100011`It is clear that the number of components is 2.

There are no 1's in the third example, so the answer is 0.
