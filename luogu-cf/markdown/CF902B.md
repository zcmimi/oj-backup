## 题目描述

You are given a rooted tree with $ n $ vertices. The vertices are numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , the root is the vertex number $ 1 $ .

Each vertex has a color, let's denote the color of vertex $ v $ by $ c_{v} $ . Initially $ c_{v}=0 $ .

You have to color the tree into the given colors using the smallest possible number of steps. On each step you can choose a vertex $ v $ and a color $ x $ , and then color all vectices in the subtree of $ v $ (including $ v $ itself) in color $ x $ . In other words, for every vertex $ u $ , such that the path from root to $ u $ passes through $ v $ , set $ c_{u}=x $ .

It is guaranteed that you have to color each vertex in a color different from $ 0 $ .

You can learn what a rooted tree is using the link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree\_(graph\_theory).

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n

The second line contains $ n-1 $ integers $ p_{2},p_{3},...,p_{n} $ ( $ 1<=p_{i}<i $ ), where $ p_{i} $ means that there is an edge between vertices $ i $ and $ p_{i} $ . The third line contains $ n $ integers $ c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n} $ ( $ 1<=c_{i}<=n $ ), where $ c_{i} $ is the color you should color the $ i $ -th vertex into. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.

### 输出格式

Print a single integer — the minimum number of steps you have to perform to color the tree into given colors.
