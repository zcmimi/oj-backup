# Maxim and Matrix

## 题目描述

Maxim loves to fill in a matrix in a special manner. Here is a pseudocode of filling in a matrix of size $ (m+1)×(m+1) $ :

Maxim asks you to count, how many numbers $ m $ $ (1<=m<=n) $ are there, such that the sum of values in the cells in the row number $ m+1 $ of the resulting matrix equals $ t $ .

Expression ( $ x $ $ xor $ $ y $ ) means applying the operation of bitwise excluding "OR" to numbers $ x $ and $ y $ . The given operation exists in all modern programming languages. For example, in languages C++ and Java it is represented by character "^", in Pascal — by "xor".

## 输入输出格式

### 输入格式

A single line contains two integers $ n $ and $ t $ $ (1<=n,t<=10^{12},t<=n+1) $ .

Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in C++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.

### 输出格式

In a single line print a single integer — the answer to the problem.
